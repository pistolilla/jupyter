Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word  ""exchange"" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing  so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in  using ""exchange"" in your corporate name, however, putting ""exchange"" in a  company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.  He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong,  so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.",jones-t

After my email went out,  Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure  sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the  exchange and less toward the tranportation.

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90%  done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer  Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a  while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like  tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft.  plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little  little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about  7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have  to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink,  yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before  they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot  of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over  Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds  and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a  bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.   I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis  fountain.  He's just lovely!  Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's  painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real  pale pink.

First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine,  we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep  in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry  about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is  always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master  would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason  to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.  Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to  mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular  out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of  Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it  Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.

I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell  you what a good job he has been doing for our group.  I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we  have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group  uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master  Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements  Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the  database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data  maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide,  while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the  online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep  track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This  need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with  online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly  respond to our client, the online trading group.  Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and  helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding  of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful  while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us  meet the needs of our clients.  Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a  valuable asset to your team! ",jones-t

1084,"Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's  ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a  governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group  where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained  to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the  relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative  transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any  relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to  obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring  outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not  have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will  not be approving them to trade financial products.  As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check  with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US  eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain  vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm  or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to  trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are  a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.  If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet  a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily  inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet  this test.

1091,"David,  Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted  into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master  database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft  form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to  manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the  Australian agreements plugged into the system.  This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of  contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take  a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with  and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a  global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take  on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if  someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and  asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in  another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the  same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort  on the counterparty front.  In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no  way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.  Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside  auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.  For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master  agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place.  Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract  records and approval for online trading.  For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our  Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside  legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the  confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The  database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have  found helpful.  You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator  requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you  get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can  figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..  Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?

""We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit.""  One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.

I  will be faxing you this evening our comments to Natural Gas.  You should have  received weather by separate email from Shari Stack.  Coal should be coming  shortly, paper is being looked at by the business people and we will have it  to you on Tuesday.

2141,Thursday's OK with me.,jones-t
2142,"Awais,  I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney  in our group, Shari Stack.  If that is the one you are talking about, it  should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling  Steve Kean and see if I get a response.",jones-t
2143,"Shari, Can you take a look at this revised market description and let me know  if its ok.  Thanks. ",jones-t
2144,"I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all  these descriptions done was the end of today.  She said she would pass the  word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.  Let me know if  that doesn't happen.",jones-t

2148,Thanks Shari!,jones-t
2149,"Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.  My goal is to get  everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve  before I have to file by June 11th.  When the financials are ready I need to  get them certified by the highest accounting officer.  Last year that was  Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting.   Will he be signing again?",jones-t
2150,I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve  Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to  legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney  in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her  comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I  receive your comments.,jones-t

2152,"After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the  products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received  it.

2168,"Mike,  You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos  Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement  Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me  and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.    Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can  you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals  (Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.  Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a  document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new  database created similar to ours?  Thanks for your help! ",jones-t
2169,"Brent,  I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.  If we don't get  you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.  Hope you are doing well...we miss you!",jones-t
2170,"I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our  meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and  haven't heard.  In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360  days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like  to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any  specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's  the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that  answered.",jones-t
2171,"That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about  the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade  between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the  proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language  we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border  trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company  (Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through  non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets  with your approval. ",jones-t
2172,"Brent,  I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement  database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use  it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I  spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have  shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need  to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working  on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to  developing a similar system for you.",jones-t
2173,"I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most  current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been  gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has  revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the  reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David  Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP  issues.",jones-t
2174,"We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to  the back of the Industrial Master.  It is still located in my form directory,  called industrial-u.s.#5.doc.",jones-t
2175,"I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.  We really do  have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a  relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response.",jones-t
2176,It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the  latest.  Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.  Can you  email me the latest draft.  Thanks!,jones-t
2177,"Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT  Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working  off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't  show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure  that we don't send them any mailouts.",jones-t
2178,Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.  I hope there was no  frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...!,jones-t
2179,"I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a  counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).  It's at  www.utilityconnection.com.  It even has non-U.S. utilities.  When you have a  minute, give it a look.",jones-t
2180,"Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for  ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in  place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to  do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada  has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks! ",jones-t

2183,"I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between  Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing  Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. ""signing""  the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in  this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12  of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with  respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same  language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better  than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their ""name"" on  the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.  All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or  issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.  Let me know if I can be of further service...",jones-t
2184,Sent again. ,jones-t

2190,I will be able to attend.,jones-t
2191,"Access to the online trading system?  If that's the questions, probably none  of us.",jones-t
2192,There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading  lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.  This project continues to be highly confidential.,jones-t
2193,"For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can  trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need  your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with  the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in  English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty  or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with  utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying  to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it  sounds like a utility or governmental.  Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the  counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?",jones-t
2194,"Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the  counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until  due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of  incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian  law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we  need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start  looking at it.",jones-t
2195,"Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us  with no changes.  NOX and SOX are attached also. ",jones-t

2198,I noticed we have 2 entries for cpy in Lotus Notes.  We need to delete one.,jones-t
2199,"Mark,  David Portz, Elizabeth Sager and I were looking at this slide and we're not  so sure it's correct.  We think it should reflect two huge power price  spikes, the recent ones of this year, and the big one of last year.  We don't  think the attached slide correctly reflects the two price spikes.  Can you  take a look at it and get back to me...thanks for your help! ",jones-t
2200,"Per the meeting today, attached is the latest counterparty list in Excel.  ",jones-t
2201,Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty  list.  I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's  approved counterparty list here in Houston.,jones-t
2202,"Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part,  state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the  country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading  will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy  companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap  trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance  companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information  until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you  cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies  to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at  individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.  The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in  active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I  know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.   You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.",jones-t
2203,"I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to  go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about  discussing any other financial issues we might have then...",jones-t
2204,I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at.   You may want to get it from her.  It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there  also.,jones-t
2205,"Scott, one of our crude oil traders passed on the attached resume of one of  his friends and asked if we could take a look at it.  I gave it to Mark  Taylor and since the fellow lives in England he thought it would be better  sent to you. ",jones-t
2206,"Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.  It's got  the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the  agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without  Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell  us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT  International).  Sorry...",jones-t
2207,"I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and  the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps  Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to  create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3)  both?",jones-t
2208,I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is  an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the  ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc.,jones-t
2209,"Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.  I don't know how  long mail takes to get there.  It will probably be there I hope in today's  mail.",jones-t
2210,"I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our  Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes  Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that  can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our  trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant  General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent  and Andrea access.  Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a  database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about  getting this new database created?  Thanks for your help!",jones-t

2212,Carol made some proposed changes to the MAC language and asked me to send it  to you to get your input. ,jones-t
2213,"Mary, although this presentation is for the Legal Dept. I thought maybe if  you have a representative from your group there it might be helpful.  Do you  have someone, like Mary Gosnell, that you would like to attend?  Let me know,  and I'll get their name added to the list. ",jones-t

2217,The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour  until 2:30 pm.,jones-t
2218,"If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking  for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am  currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information  America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are  you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well  as others...!",jones-t

2223,"Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English  culture, the Morris Men.  I've got their website bookmarked.  Y'all are a  goofy bunch.  Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with  switches.  It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English  culture to me.  I am constantly amused!  If y'all would only cheer at  marathons...!",jones-t
2224,"Shouldn't we be setting a time for a form meeting so we can review those  documents (Deemed ISDA, legal opinions, etc.) I distributed a while back?",jones-t
2225,"That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to  Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or  laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.   Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in  effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you  need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and  we'll give them a call.",jones-t

Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with  respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore  be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are  there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the  governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not  be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others?   Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our  agreements?

2234,"How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your  cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The  grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights  of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit  seemed all too short.

2238,"The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus  causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is  the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some  time.  The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current  fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to  the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in  reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains  in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend  crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?  We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch! ",jones-t
2239,"Taffy, can you work with Nicola to get this conf. call set up with London, in  Suzanne's absence.  Thanks! ",jones-t

She looked up Gary Bode, who  Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager,  but she didn't see his direct boss on the chart.  She suggested for the  Fishkin Project that we try and use Inja Chun, a woman she says is very good,  or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very  expensive!...just kidding!)  I'm going to give Danny Clark a call to see who  at EES is using Documentum to manage their documents.

2276,"As far as your email questions, my responses are following:  1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial  counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow. 2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note  below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility  counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal  regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters  in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of  negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the  relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot  approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company  websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility  or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due  diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or  federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only  make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me. 3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a  regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website  what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that  Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway. 4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel,  unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to  enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws  specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this  until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say ""no"" for  Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with. 5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an  eligible swap participant (or ""ESP"").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives  trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain  financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies,  banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth  and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say  ""not ESP"" or ""not eligible swap participant"" it means they have not met the  financial net worth test. 6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.   ",jones-t

I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box  they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you  cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a  wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.  Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out  the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing  any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good  businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a  job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the  cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a  lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his  additional time or money on.

It looks like the London based officers who  could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you  are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for  the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in  Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's  signature.

2312,"Below are my responses to your email:  1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation  in the master only:   per our conversation. 2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price  swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in  the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot  trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy. 3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the  due diligence on this country at this time. 4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1 5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below. 6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to  the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack  of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency  transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open  them for trading any commodity. 7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above. 8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy  commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest  rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we  could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a  fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi. 9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have  agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master. 10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with  them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other  trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from  their Board of Directors.  So they are still ""no"" for online derivatives  trading. 11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance  companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have  special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not  address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master  in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation &  bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval  for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds  of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type  of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say ""no"" to online trading  based on these special handling procedures. 12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say ""yes"" to online derivatives trading,  however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have  a master in place with. 13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above. 14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status. 15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above. 16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for  this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided  to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless  their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed  above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from  Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password  Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these  special signatory requirements. 17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above. 18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.  Critical Changes to my list:  1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to  request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in  Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a  master in place. 2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master  appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this  resolved, we are switching them to a ""no"".  Per my meeting today with Credit:  I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility  or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will  get back to you.  My Review of Your List:  List #1  1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from  your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with.   ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT  Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to  energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5 2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and  trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to  do with these situations when we have more than one master in place. 3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping  issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S.  Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, ""bought their  book"".  We actually couldn't ""buy their book"" because of our low credit  rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all  payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity  business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap  (not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were  to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to  the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any,  trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and  find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue. 4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty.   Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the  master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of  the Credit override. 5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power  Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2)  Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a  utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place,  approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master,  would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place,  approved for all trading.

Per our  discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all  outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus.

Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts. 2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our  discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the  approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a ""B"" approved  GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the  credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was  still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to  him.

It did not allow the agreement to be  provided to affiliates.  Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement  in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that  is doing the deal down in Argentina.  Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke  Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's  permission to give them a copy of the agreement.  That it what I am trying to  resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give  Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.

2337,"Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project  I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor  was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of  work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.    You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based  commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.  Mark has  been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of  work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have  been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts,  which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether  we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has  meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and  trading restrictions.  As far as my ""Fishkin"" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an  internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals,  objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking  at, some we found out Enron already has.    Mark and I are discussing what  we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our  thoughts soon.   Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a  Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design  the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA  opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have  been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as  well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put  this database together and start loading the information.  So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!  P.S.  Thanks for the article!",jones-t

It is important on a going forward basis that if we  veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if  Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that  Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same  understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to  your email I have the following comments:  1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.   Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific  officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot  trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.   All their  trades must be done by telephone. 2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities  such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all! 3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the  transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT  and Aspect. 4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial  trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us,  either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they  provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading  in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master  agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time. 5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have  informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In  reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we  probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the  master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade. 6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we  resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do  have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin  trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master.",jones-t
2346,"I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.  The presentation  was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it  could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and  swap agreement form templates.  I need to talk to our confirm desk people to  see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were  hoping this system could address.   They had one concept for form generation  I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.  The  concept was this ""data dictionary"".  It made it all clear to me.  I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked  them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come  back to us before I leave for Europe in June.",jones-t

Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU  IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE  PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect  counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the  counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I  ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.  Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which  contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts,  in the same way you resolve such issues on an ""off-line"" basis.  Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will  forward them to you as soon as I receive them. ",jones-t

We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates  from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are  responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London  Legal for London based customers.  A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around  the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both  Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office  is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while  London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide  copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we  both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the  approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept.  is responsible for their own clients.  As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the  advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can  transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks  in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their  appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and  further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of  process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since  what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we  don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a  counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time  resolving those issues.  As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest  of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can  certainly change our policies at any time.

Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also,  we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.  Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a  big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to  start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her  resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also,  keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise  paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.  Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire  paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by  Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good  way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her  undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more  options in other groups.  As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.  I'm just  surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my  mileage to 6.  It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.

My  understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the  Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.   The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong  agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been  proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the  intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement  is a very bad idea.

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved  to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the  European products, including specifically European physical power products  (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).  Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to  check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the  products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).  What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with  respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap  Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power,  which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone  up for unless we really mean it.  So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian  based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going  to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down  for European physical power. ",jones-t

All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed  to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by  email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company  and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for  EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I  prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the  dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so  an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some  other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).  3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to  circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate  the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed  with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should  also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her,  except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).  4.

3785,"I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall ""system""  still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to  upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some  additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the  autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating  to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the  database to all interested ENA employees.    I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.    First is our"" jurisdictional database"", which will summarize the swap laws as  they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its  becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the  database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start  briefing the country information soon.  Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been  online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the  business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract  information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and  on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties  we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We  have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.  The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal  advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical,  power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has  in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them  is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they  want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among  other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition,  all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from  outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this  Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being  scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the  documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents  available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although  compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might  be more of a problem.  The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all  these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces  before the overall system.   Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.",jones-t

3826,"As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to  your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the  following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from  time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next  week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light  of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark  Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your  attention.   One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every  financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.   The Houston forms are currently located in a ""read-only"" directory.  We need  to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they  use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use  creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms  evolve without  approval.  Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is  when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap  agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation  change, if you make it in every agreement.  Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily  accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical  component of the Fishkin Project).

From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason  prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the  products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the  contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the  particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently  opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian  financial power.  2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?    Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties  too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts  on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they  are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not  approve the London based counterparties.  3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every  confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need  to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding  that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so  we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.

I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to  me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?

In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online    language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions,  business day defined as Sydney only, etc.  Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or  will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely  counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in  place.

Additionally, at the  bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password  Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.  The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have  missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel  spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information  for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about  6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from  the original approval lists.  As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a  counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been  entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for  everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will  delete them.  I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look  and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the  kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along,  so this database may evolve over time.

Let me know if you have change access by mistake.  On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database  confidential to the group we have granted view access to.

It was my understanding that he had not seen a  comprehensive list off all the products we offer.  2.

Houston Legal does it every day for every new  Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every  new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the  same.
