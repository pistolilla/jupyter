That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.  Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.

4,"Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer  that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will  use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a  special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the  customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this  customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf  credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know  how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works  out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a  CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at  that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.   Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,  settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test  Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for  July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES  take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's  pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?   If yes, how many meters?  2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples   Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume  Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's  pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to  EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES  is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.  Marde I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the  payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will  you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you  can anwser this.   ",germany-c

51,"There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.    Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to:",germany-c

1638,"We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective  6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract  to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.   FSS  We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.   However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth  on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like  Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.    IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel  is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any  point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we  withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.  COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy  and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel  1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July,  and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge  on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in  Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track  of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is  capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback  and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on  this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any  withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to  keep the tickets balanced.  Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy,  Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.  Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to  capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with  the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can  ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at  today's prices that cost about $.105  Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and  payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055,  assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.  Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the  Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on  segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot  use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.  Let me know if you have any questons.",germany-c

But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.   We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.

Keep looking for my BOAT.  Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.  Nothing else going on.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, ""the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great"" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.   However, we do support intra-day capacity release.   ",germany-c

2131,"   One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway. It just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.  He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.  With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!  Now, the Moral of the Story: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!  Remember the five simple rules to be happy: 1. Free your heart from hatred. 2. Free your mind from worries. 3. Live simply. 4. Give more. 5. Expect less.  P.S.: The donkey later came back and kicked THE SHIT out of the bastard that tried burying him.  Moral: When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you.",germany-c

2454,"i took the test and this is what it said. colors green blue yello purple red black white orange You are a very sensitive person and you try hard (perhaps a little too hard) to make favourable impressions and to be recognised by your peers. But you have that inherent need to feel appreciated and admired and you are easily hurt if all of your endeavours go by unappreciated or not acknowledged. Stop trying so hard. You are very talented, imaginative and sensitive but you are holding back as you do not really like going it 'on your own'. In preference you would like to team up with someone, someone with similar attributes as your own, to explore - to seek out and go perhaps 'where no other man has trod before'. It is the unusual that attracts you and which will give you a sense of excitement and adventure. Everything seems to have gone wrong and the situation at this time is such that you are not quite sure which way to turn. So it would appear that you are 'holding back', re-consolidating your position and relinquishing all fun and games for the time being. You are holding back. You need to find friends in whom you can trust and once they have proved themselves beyond all possible doubt you will be prepared to give them your all. The existing situation is not of your liking - you have an unsatisfied need for mental stimulation with others whose standards are as high as your own. Trying to control your instincts the way you do restricts your ability to open up to others and the way you feel at this time is suggestive of 'total surrender'. This is not to your liking as you consider such thoughts as weaknesses that need to be overcome. You feel that only by control, controlling your innermost thoughts, are you able to maintain your air of superiority. You want to be admired for yourself alone and not for what you can do or for what you may have done. In essence 'you need to be needed' and at the same time 'you need to need'. You need to be respected as an exceptional individual. This is the only way that you can hope to achieve the status that you wish to achieve. You set yourself very high standards - and come what may - you abide by them. Don't date or hook yourself up with a hussy.

For the final test, the CIA agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""We must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. Inside of this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Kill her!!!"" The man said, ""You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife."" The agent said, ""Then you are not the right man for this job.""  The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. Then the man came out with tears in his eyes. ""I tried, but I can't kill my wife."" The agent said, ""You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.""  Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""This gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat him to death with the chair.""  Moral: Women are evil. Don't mess with them.",germany-c

As Bob mentioned in his earlier message we must now reduce our Wholesale Group to reflect that we, ILA, do not have the credit capacity to continue to support the needs of the business.  Starting today we will begin to wind down our Commodity Services and CapitalServices groups, both in North America and in Europe, with the goal of being significantly out of all commercial operations by the end of the summer.  Later today we will take the first step to reduce the headcount of the organization.  For many of our fellow workers today will be the last day at Aquila.  For those not released today, we will need to, as carefully and responsibly as possible, put our beloved company to bed.  At the end of this process, the remaining employees, as is true with me, will be let go.   No one is to blame, it is just an unfortunate reality we have found ourselves in, and we are left with this ugly choice.

2516,"Recommendation for ENA Pools 1st choice  Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/3/01, no cash flow and everything is pre-petition. 2nd choice Terminate pools and producer contracts on 12/31/01 and deal with one month's cash flow 3rd choice  Terminate pools as soon as possible to eliminate the administrative effort involved.  I've been trying to determine the EES imbalances on Dominion and I'm not having much luck.  Dominion gave me the ENA balances over the phone.  When I called back a day later to get the EES balances, I was told to submit a written request to Bill Saviers, Dominion's in house counsel.  I have not done that.  I would prefer that Dominion provide us a written document stating what the pool balances are as of 11/30/01 and 12/31/01.    Based on the pool balances below, I would recommend terminating the ENA pools effective 12/3/01 assuming the following. 	1.  Producer payments for Oct and Nov have not been made and go into the pre-petition bucket. 	2.  ENA owes Dominion gas which is also pre-petition. 	3.  The producers will be able to reallocate their gas for December forward to another marketer's pool.  Items to consider If we terminate the pools on 12/31/01 or later, ENA will need to sell the imbalance gas and pay the producers.  Dominion will need to provide ENA a method to do this if the pools are terminated.  I would recommend paying the producers after we collect the money for selling the imbalance gas AND after we pay Dominion any gathering/transporting charges associated with those balances.  The volumes are small so ENA will not see much economic benefit from this process.  Also, the administrative effort involved is VERY VERY HIGH due to the small volumes per producer.  Dominion will prefer to cancel the pools with a 0 or positive imbalance.  On 12/3/01, ENA will still have a negative cumulative imbalance.  Most of the producers have not been paid for Oct or Nov 2001 activity.  I assume that since those dollars go into a pre-petition bucket that we should not terminate any producer contracts before 12/3/01.  	 3/5/02 Per Vickie Coen at Dominion ENA Pool Balances as of 			11/30/01	12/31/01	 Gath North		1,323		2,187		 Tran North		0		0 Gath South		(26,482)		31,583 Tran South		5,412		8,143  Cumulative		(19,747)		41,913   Dominion IF Prices Mar 2002	$2.59 Feb 2002	$2.20 Jan 2002	$2.79 Dec 2001	$2.42 Nov 2001	$3.37 Oct 2001	$2.02 Sep 2001	$2.42  ",germany-c

2530,"Ruth Concannon told me we want to try and sell the parked gas on Sonat.  This is what we have found out over the last 2 days.  ENA no longer has the ability to do nominations on Sonat's scheduling Christina Sanchez (ENA Scheduler) believes that under normal conditions, we can sell the parked gas on Sonat without doing any nominations.  The party we sell the gas to would nominate the gas away from a specific PAL meter and reference our PAL contract as the upstream contract.  Today I spoke with Tammi Depaolis at Sequent - she is interested in buying the gas and she might prepay for it.  I need to know;  1.  What volume to sell, I assume we are talking about 188,949 dth on deal #1222, which means we ignore the loaned volume of 96,000 dth on deal #1424. 2.  What period do I sell the gas for?  All out by March 31st subject to the operational conditions on the pipeline?  Or base load in April?  I prefer all out by March 31st but I would like to ask the pipeline if that's ok? 3.  How many bids do I need to get?  I called Sequent because I know they are active on Sonat. 4.  This may not matter but did Sonat ever pay us for the gas ENA sold them in January 2002 (see items in red down below).  Tammi will probably check with the pipeline to see if its ok to take our gas.  I don't want to sell gas to someone then find out the pipeline will not let them take it.  All of my previous notes are shown below in blue.   Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  Sonat's motion is set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.",germany-c

2538," Kay, ENA has a user ID on a system called Pegasys.  Peoples Gas invoices ENA about $400.00 a month for a License Fee, Customer Service Charge, and taxes and it looks like we have not paid this bill for the last 3 months.  In the pre-petition world, we used this ID to do nominations on the Peoples Gas system.  We are not currently using this ID and it looks like we no longer need an ID for this system.  BUT, Kevin Brady, an ENA scheduler, uses an Enovate and EMW LLC id to do nominations for those companies. Enovate is paying the invoices for those companies.  Can we cancel this ID, or should we just tell Peoples we are not going to pay the invoice and let them terminate the ID at their discretion?  Will not paying the ENA invoice impact EMW LLC or Enovate in any way?",germany-c

TDC stated that it would ""file a claim for administrative expenses in the bankruptcy court in New York and seek all other necessary relief against ENA"" if ENA did not remit payment by the close of business Feb 22, 2002.  Based on the information in this email it appears that ENA should pay TDC $203,196.00.    Kay, Ed, Question:  I have not contacted TDC to determine if they have filed a claim with the court.  Would that have any impact on making a payment to TDC?  Should I contact TDC?

2640,"  Hi everybody. It's Steve Cooper. It's Friday afternoon, March 1. I hope everybody has had a great week. I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.  The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion. I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues. Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable. I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.  In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund. We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees. I wanted you to be aware of that. I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset.  Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program. As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.  The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee. We provided to them more data. Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28. We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program.  I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority. It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed. I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court. I'll keep you posted on progress. I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs. Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.  The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions. Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week. Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases. And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process. So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.  We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract. It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate. I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund. I'd like your input on that. I thought it was a great idea and very generous.  We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month. Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there. I've tried to get around to say hello here and there. And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz. Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries.  Other than that I don't have a lot to report. We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program. Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area. I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.  One other thing...  We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon. We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here. We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting. I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future. I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.  Anyway, as I was saying...  Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication. I hope you have a great weekend. I'll chat with next week. ",germany-c

2726,"This is what I want to send to our ""Team"".  Would you please do a quick review just before I send it out?   These are my notes on the Sonat Park & Loan.  I have not spoken with any legal counsel representing ENA.  Summary:  Sonat has netted our Parked Gas Balance with our Loaned Gas Balance and filed a motion with the courts to retain the remaining Parked Gas Balance, 92,949 dth per my conversation with Sonat, to offset $879,030.42 ENA owes Sonat for the purchase of gas in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the payment was due November 26, 2001 but ENA did not pay.  ENA recognizes a balance of 197,537 dth - the difference is ENA is not netting the 96,000 dth Loan with the park and Sonat is showing and additional day of withdrawal of 8,588 dth in January 2002.    Chris's notes: Sonat Park & Loans  2/19/02  History  - Per Dave Dyer (205-326-2007) at Sonat  ENA has 2 Park & Loan (PAL) contracts with Sonat.  All PAL's with Sonat are under master contract PAL1001.  Sonat assigns a deal number to each deal under this contract.    Deal #1424 - ENA borrowed a total of 96,000 dth from Nov 3rd-5th and has not paid this back.  ENA still owes Sonat 96,000 dth.  The terms of the deal were to payback Sonat anytime with 3 days notice on any 3 days on 2002,   SONAT ONLY CHARGED ENA $96.00 FOR THIS DEAL, because Sonat needed to get gas off the system.  Deal #1222 - ENA parked 309,192 dth in August to come out in Jan 2002.  Sonat let ENA withdraw 42,951 on 11/29/01 leaving a balance of 266,241 dth.  In Jan 2002, ENA withdrew 8,588 dth per day for the 1st-9th.  That left a balance of 188,949 dth.  On Jan 8th, 2002, Sonat sent a letter stating that Sonat will hold on to the remaining to balance to offset 1) the Loaned gas on deal #1424 (96,000 dth) and 2) to offset dollars ENA has not paid Sonat for gas Sonat sold to ENA in October 2001.  According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  According to Sonat's letter, Sonat has filed the appropriate motion for court approval for the offsets.  According to Dave, ENA is being billed $.00305 x daily balance in this account.  ENA should have paid some bigger amount went the gas was parked in August.  Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).  ENA used 77,292 dth (8,588 dth per day for Jan 1st - 9th) of the parked gas on deal #1222 to supply the 16,000 dth before Sonat stopped ENA from withdrawing from the park.  ENA defaulted on 418,708 dth of the Sonat deal in January.  Sonat's in house legal counsel is Patti Frances (205-325-7696).  I left a message for Patti to call me.  2/20/02 Patti Frances returned my call.  Patti said the motion is currently set to be reviewed by the court on March 6th.  I asked Patti if there were any penalties for not performing on the Jan 2002 sale to Sonat and if Sonat was going to pay for the 77,292 dth that ENA did supply.  Patti said she didn't think there were penalties but she would verify that and see if they were going to pay.  I also asked her if Sonat is still honoring the ENA sale to Sonat in May 2002 and if Sonat would pay ENA if ENA performed.  She will check on it and call me back. ",germany-c

According to Sonat, the remaining balance on this deal is 92,949 dth = [309,192 parked in Aug - 42,951 w/d in Nov - 77,292 w/d in Jan - 92,000 balance on #1424].  Other items; ENA purchased system supply from Sonat in October 2001.  ENA purchased 286,998 at an average price of $3.063 = $879,030.42.  According to Sonat, ENA did not pay for this before Enron declared bankruptcy.  ENA also sold Sonat gas - 16,000 dth day at $2.885 (sitara #1172076) in January 2002 and 10,000 dth day at $2.955 in May 2002 (sitara #1172087).",germany-c

It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up.  I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals.

If we are unable to purchase gas from TXU or Reliant, we will use the Bear Creek storage gas on Tennessee to supply the Tallahassee deal.  This is what we did on the 2nd-6th.  I am also anticipating that the discounted IT rate on Tennessee will be higher for gas flow on the 7th.  My goal is to maintain 2 active suppliers (with prepays) on the East Coast, TXU and Reliant.  I would also like to set up a trading contract with another supplier (maybe Coral) in case TXU or Reliant decides to stop doing business with ENA.  Our supplier for the swing gas on the Tallahassee deal in January was Sequent.  However, last Thursday, Sequent stopped doing business with ENA because it was too much of a burden for them to keep track of the ENA prepays and the daily volumes.

Aaron told me that they would sell us gas under the following conditions,  	the deal has to be on PanCanadian's paper 	we need to let PanCanadian know by 8:00 AM every morning 	and ENA must take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays.  This is a problem because Tallahassee does not have to take the same daily volumes over weekends and holidays and Tallahassee does not need to notify ENA until 9:00 AM.  Aaron will see if they can work with a 9:00 AM deadline.   ",germany-c

I think he also said he is trying to resurrect the Con Ed deal - which is probably similar to the Lilco deal with respect to the pipelines it flows on.  Transco does not have a pooling contract like many of the other pipelines on the East.

No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.  If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity  to you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG capacity to you.

We have 3 options on serving this deal:  1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone  SL Pool 2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead 3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65  Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after  paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the  prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone  SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02  (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with  Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this  is a term firm sale to NYPA.

ENA billed CES (now  New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power  for the gas taken out of storage.  In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e  effective 11/1/2000.  Take a look - let me know if you have any comments. ",germany-c

Not a big deal for  October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again  for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party  gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.  Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your  transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel  and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what  the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on  the worksheet.  So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

4811,"We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective  6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract  to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS.   FSS  We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.   However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth  on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like  Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.    IAS We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel  is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any  point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we  withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.  COST What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy  and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel  1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July,  and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge  on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in  Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track  of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is  capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback  and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on  this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any  withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to  keep the tickets balanced.  Payback Techniques Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy,  Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.  Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to  capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with  the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can  ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at  today's prices that cost about $.105  Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and  payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055,  assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.  Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the  Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on  segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot  use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.  Let me know if you have any questons.",germany-c

I will  use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a  special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the  customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this  customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf  credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know  how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works  out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a  CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at  that price but I will.  Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.   Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES,  settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test  Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for  July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES  take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?  Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's  pool.

4913,"There are five CNG postings listed below.  Posting #1 APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE  POSTED May 23, 2000  Dear West Virginia Producer,  Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing  additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative  projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you  more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our  gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression  into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a  limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make  this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.  For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a  period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and  Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for  compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE  compressor station.  The Dominion ""bubbles"" affected are 4404 & 4405.    Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental  capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental  capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the  limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it  receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably  interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering  the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the  Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the  amount of ""incremental"" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing  time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure  that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other  producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression  in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights  to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more  requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for  which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.  Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the  proposed  location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include  the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression  agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation,  phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should  be included (please print or type).  Forward this information to:",germany-c

If possible I would  like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes  through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas  on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we  are buying back gas at GD - $.01.  3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill  CES directly for this?    4.  See attached worksheets.  5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The  pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing  using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.   Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she  will recreate Jan - Mar.  6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about  the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about  total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take  additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and  you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as  well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...
