Neil and I have a date night tomorrow,  so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the  downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.  I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell  Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave  me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go  with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a  neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will  be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I  did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.  Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the  hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them.   They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will  have a late night.  You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to  bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it.  My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is  transferring with me, but I'm not sure.

Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power  development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we  wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me  that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance  of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.   This change in focus should make power development deals easier to  structure.    I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose  Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the  West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting  with Herman would also be helpful.

There was a breakout contract done for the CA Development deal, and Pete  Thompson (with AK out of DC) would have generated that document.  It wasn't  approved by the TurboPark team since it was entered into by the Enron LLC  post TurboPark.

Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2  (a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine  Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.  3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement.   5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".  7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific  performance?  9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing  of the letter agreement.  Should say by closing such will have been  obtained.  I haven't done a reg evaluation, so I would delete the reg rep  unless you are comfortable.

I have a call in to Dale.  3.  No LLC.  Kathleen will handle.  The closer the creation is to the signing  of the letter, the better, taking into account the time required to get the  docs back and set up.  Someone needs to name it.  We should also look at a  minimal list of officers.  4.  I don't have the attachment in front of me, so I will have to look it  up.  I'll get back to you.  The concept is that ENA is only responsible for  changes in the amounts owed to GE as of the closing date.  I thought the  language was awkward, and tried to make it more clear, but obviously failed!   As soon as I get the break out contract from Dale we can check on the  definitional questions.

When we priced  these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package  instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a  third.

613,"Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the  best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's  Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases,  was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further  distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine  SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content.  This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210  horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated  to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined  power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers.  Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing.  Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its    theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps.  Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a  distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone.  Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An  all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame  design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches -  thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance  to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically  improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits  flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling  even more, while increasing interior room.  Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002  Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and  a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment,  although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does  intrude through the floor.  New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power  adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front  seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety  features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower  front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in  the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac  traction/stability control system will also be available.  The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine  choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market,  but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the  golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float  your boat.

719,"		  		 		 		?EDMUNDS' REVIEW 		 		Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a  new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that  tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough  for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty.  Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end  grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked  against newer competitors.  		So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is  finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar  powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter,  DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of  torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25  foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go  mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear.  		The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the  latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged  at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive  system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying  the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD,  automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on  the dashboard.  		We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling,  further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the  friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated  instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and  12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws.  		You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model  year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security  system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual  transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which  includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents.  		All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD  player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in  leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same  models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic  transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which  includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and  play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after  Christmas, don't we?). A ""Birdview"" navigation system, shared with the  Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the  ""Birdview"" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty  buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions.  Get a map.  		Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo  carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a  relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should  have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations.  		Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the  Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive  package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of  the Dodo. ",mann-k

722,"Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a  Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself  as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure?  Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types  of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.  Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on  modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider  where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size,  the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or  better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too.  Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with  electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes  braking power during a panic stop).  Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to  meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood  of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at  4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i).  The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a  2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The  four-speed automatic transmission provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on  slippery surfaces.  With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully  independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle  tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle  Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and  is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's  steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck  (car?) back under control.  In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects  occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point  seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR),  front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat  anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.  Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear  60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded.  Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control,  tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard.  Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control,  remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size  spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather  upholstery is available on V6 models.  Toyota is planning to sell 70,000 Highlanders in calendar year 2001. We'll  bet demand outstrips supply.  B",mann-k

I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.  Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to  your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)

I always thought that was strange, and sure created  clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does  Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave  many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed the laws,  though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've remembered.  If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday  at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21.

We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas),  market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.   We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the  balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I  will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.   Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO  Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would  like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.    Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have  developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me  about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted  Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of  experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for  some information on his background.    SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the  equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of  this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a  turbine/generator set) to Calpine.    Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a  company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We  received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.   We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them  buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and  the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as  funding is figured out.  There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.  GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a  standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be  buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.    I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.  Kay",mann-k

ENA Legal is responsible for deal documentation and legal sign off for the  transaction, and is typically responsible for all transaction-related  agreements documents such as MOUs/MOIs, Participation or Development  Agreements, and any Agreement, which directs the operation of the project  (O&M Agreement, Steam Agreement, Gas Agreement, Power Purchase Agreement,  etc.).    2. ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and  development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all  legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as  required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.    3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax  in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as  required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the  structure.   Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting  documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been  agreed.   2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at  the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same  project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of  any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance  with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained. 3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next  draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with  the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to  vendors. 4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to  both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as  possible.  Forms of ""standard"" agreements should be discussed/agreed to  enhance consistency. 5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction  which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should  be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the  existence of such service agreements. 6.  ENA Legal would should work closely with EE&CC contract administrators in  drafting equipment in the preparation of contracts which the contracts  personnel have been tasked to prepare. EECC Legal can assist by providing  input, but is not required by ENA to sign off on such contracts.",mann-k

1057,"	Antitrust Division Won't Challenge Electricity Distribution Cooperative  WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power  distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to  retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business  review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could  find no lessening of competition in any electric power market.  The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations  formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide  electric service predominantly to rural consumers.  Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers  that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income  to its member/customers.  Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates  competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1,  2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas  will change greatly. Consumers now purchase electricity only from the  regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is  located. Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric  energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's  incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's  door under regulated distribution charges.  The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing  activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's  regulated transmission and distribution activities. To ensure that the  utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its  relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the  transmission and distribution system operations are required to function  independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at  retail.  The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard  service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an  alternative energy service provider. Distribution cooperatives, under the  act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or  they may assign them to an affiliate. The rates for the standard service  package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer  a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission.  The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to  create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers  throughout Arkansas. All retail marketing activities outside the traditional  local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through  the joint marketing venture. If a distribution cooperative decides to  withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for  any and all consumers.  The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide  individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its  default customers to the joint venture.  Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric  power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power  capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of  the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint  venture is likely to market.  The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give  it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets  than would be attainable by individual members.   Procompetitive Effects  In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas  Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not  appear to have any anticompetitive effect.  He commented that ""while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as  potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets  and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs  make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if  they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition.""  Melamed added that ""the existence of other, larger potential entrants into  [the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate,  any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture  proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail  marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an  additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the  distribution cooperatives.""  The business review letter is available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/--the  Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review  request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust  Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th  St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004.

We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better.  Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be  responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine  contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at  closing.  Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them  on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table?   Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days  after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something  they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but  we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.   Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the  indemnities lasting longer.  I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.  I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the  facility agreement.  14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the  equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate ""or any other  third party"" on the fifth line.  Defined terms:  ""Commercial operations"" isn't in the definitions of the  turbine contract, although there may be a definition imbedded in their  somewhere (an EECC specialty).  Please verify.

1462,"Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant  Tom Knudson   May. 16, 2001  Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN  Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World  Reporter (TM)   Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss  Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four  environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four  signed an agreement not to ""participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory  challenge"" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial  concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental ""monitoring and research.""   Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been  difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and  permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that  money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor  of economic development.  Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their  concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it,  especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and  Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.  So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement  with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on  the marine environment.  Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.  Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in  mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:  $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of  seawater.  $425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor  heated seawater discharge in the ocean.  $1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to  monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the  Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter  Project.  $100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for  injured animals onto power plant property.  $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for  infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.  $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in  Moss Landing.  $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle  Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to  maintain the trail.  ""It is very disheartening,"" said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along  with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider  an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.  ""These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the  attorneys,"" said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources  Control Board. ""We could have been much more successful with their help. But  there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them.""  Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director  for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that  was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal  possible in the current energy climate.  ""Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right  now,"" said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources  on line.  The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in  2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy  expansion plan.  No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine  Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the  Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000  each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that  helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.  Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said  the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a  biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey  Bay.  ""Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation,"" he said. ""Not a  penny comes to me.""  Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been  stirred by a handful of people.  ""It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies,"" said Duke spokesman  Tom Williams. ""Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was  designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort  level.""  The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than  $12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in  connection with the plant modernization.  The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a  nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to  ""mitigate"" environmental impacts of the plant.  Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote ""the wise use and  conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands,"" its Web site says.  However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is  inadequate.  ""If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would  say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board  for the price of mitigation,"" Chabot said. ""The agencies got bought off  cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners.""  Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation ""must be based  on science, not on buying anybody off,"" he said. ""That is inappropriate, and  we would not participate in that.  ""That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any  environmentalist.""  Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection  office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. ""We are confident it  will improve the slough ecosystem,"" he said.  Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a  citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the  recipients of Duke's payments a ""shopping list"" of government agencies,  environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical  of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.  ""You know what bothers me?"" Clark said. ""Environmental groups get tons of  donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big  corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem  with that.""  Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of  natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased  from PG&E in 1998.  If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for  more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.  ""This is a big deal,"" said Williams, the Duke spokesman. ""It will be the  largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose  the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of  California.""  Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system,  which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss  Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They  argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate  water.  ""Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the  harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with  much of the marine life cooked and dead,"" said Steve Shimek, executive  director of the Otter Project.  For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by  Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the  plant's impact on the environment.  ""There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing  harm to the environment,"" said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our  Shores. ""We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue.""  Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial  payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.  The process ""gave me tremendous pause and great concern,"" Nichols said. ""I  knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong  thing.""  She was right.  ""As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy  wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods,"" said Clark, of the  citizens group.  Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy  approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions  if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.  Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison  between the two offers, calling it ""grossly unfair and inaccurate.""  Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain  the process. ""It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical,"" she  said.  Shimek took a different view. ""We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward  monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to  haunt them,"" he said.  ""Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we  did.""  ",mann-k

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let  the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment  would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it  would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.  Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm  just wondering what is public info.

1868,"Fuel cells kindle investor energy By Beverly Goodman Redherring.com, November 27, 2000  Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even  though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on  the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time  we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're  talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear  source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly  efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity.  And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the  pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect  that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors  more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop  reading here. There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they  provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than  traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most  only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as  by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of  hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is  heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing  is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells  will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that  manufacture them. During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices,  fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment.  Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in  the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit  they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent  since last November. Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq:  HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq:  PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem  to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole  picture. ""We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"" says  William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. ""The deregulation  in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is  in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based  economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an  increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the  combustion engine."" Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so  profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have  proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become  mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still  holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology  due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers  within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing)  curve. CELL DIVISION The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary,  portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large  stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to  David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter.  ""We're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"" he says, noting that fuel  cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential  energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out). Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80  percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent  efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell  Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize  them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months  and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50  stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of  metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and  discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE  undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times  estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5  percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124. Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are  also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP ), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly  all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel  cell-powered generator to market in 2001. ""They don't make promises they're  not able to keep,"" says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at  Merrill Lynch. ""They've never disappointed."" Ballard has also made  significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis,  a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE:  DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004,  and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's  involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to  expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to  approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those  earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock  price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices. INDUSTRY REVOLUTION Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion  has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive  sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit  Auto Show, ""Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the  internal combustion engine."" Legislation such as California's mandate that by  2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on  alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance. While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to  see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel  delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's  products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5  billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S  ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in  Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the  alternative fuel industry.) ""They're involved with almost every aspect of  General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and  implementation efforts,"" Mr. Fogel says. Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent  off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006  earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel  arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a  conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel  sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to  return to its high in the coming 12 months. Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will  inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which  ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a  joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change  course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a  price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell  powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now  wants to develop a ""grid parallel"" system, which would work in tandem with  the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq  turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13  to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate  to get that stock back on track.

2072,"Barbara has asked that I submit a weekly report about what I'm working on.  I  haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket  items:  Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.  Enron owns equity and holds warrants for  Fuel Cell stock.  We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the  benefit of the warrants.  The commercial team is  working on a deal to place  50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.  I  have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently  completed the LOI with CRRA.  We need to move to more definitive docs with  CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete. The decision about whether the  state will fund the project is expected in December.  This deal is likely to  continue to take up a large amount of  my time, and requires a fair amount of  travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.  This transaction is on Dave  D and Janet D's radar screen, and  Mark is familiar with it.  The potential  upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.  Turbopark.  Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects.   Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.  This  requires a series of contracts with GE (at least 6) which I am working on.   We also have to move transformers into this facility, so I have been in  contact with ABB concerning same.    GE general.  ENA is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with GE.   I've been working with Sheila on this one.  We are committed to finish this  project by the end of this year.  Westinghouse warranty issues.  ENA has two significant disputes wiht  Westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines.  I'm riding herd on resolving  the issues.  VEPCO.  We were attempting to negotiate a PPA with Virginia Power, but ran  into some problems, so it won't close this year.  Theres' some miscellaneous  follow up work to do.  Illinois development.  I'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power  plant sites in Illinois.  Enron/Peoples joint venture.  I'm working with the Enron commercial team in  certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running.

2080,"Scott,  As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's  group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my  understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as  you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We  can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to  questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access  the resources in their group, however.  FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for  you to look at.  As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is  too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent.  Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring  a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing  facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell  their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something  peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.  Kay",mann-k
2081,"Here's a rough cut.  Let me know what you think.  The fuel cells will be subjected to testing after installation to ensure that  each fuel cell meets the performance criteria prior to CRRA accepting the  units.  These tests will measure heat rate, electrical output, air emissions,  noise levels and water consumption, and will last at least one hour each.  In  addition, a seventy-two hour test will be run to ascertain that each unit is  capable of producing the required output without outages. The final test  protocol will establish the number of tests to be performed.  Heather:  There was a proposed ASME standard relating to the testing of fuel  cells, but I don't know if it has been adopted yet.  If it has been, we could  make reference to that fact that the tests will be conducted in conformance  with ASME PT-50, or whatever it is.  I'm sure Ric knows.  Kay ",mann-k

2159,"Off the internet:   	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend  	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000--  	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants  	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of  contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R)  (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract  is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and  operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison  Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for  $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in  Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using  methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter  of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA.  	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions  	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction  project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using  coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs  for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell  Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing  emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced  by using a fuel that is essentially free.  	   said Leitman.  	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high  efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through  combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of  producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less  noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process.  	About FuelCell Energy, Inc.  	FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a  leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power  generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel  processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a  product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and  reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation.  FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power  plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been  developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S.  Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory  (NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on  developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate  clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the  customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and  industrial applications.

2186,"Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	(Corrected 1:59 pm) 	 	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules  proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron  Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was  discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said.  	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to  300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron  said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator  projects with the California Independent System Operator.  	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price  setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become  a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from  the public, or it could be modified.  	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the  ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a  total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for  installing the new generators, which the power companies will own.  	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the  generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the  power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered  CalPX.  	""There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost  associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital  commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"" Enron's Mark Palmer said.  	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed  concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects.  	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of  California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were  three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand  for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more  than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights  on.

I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which  were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing  to tell you how much I enjoyed it.  I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the  indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was  beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children  present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there  were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the  first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother  to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring  Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't  offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at  intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.  Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was  offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university  which prides itself on ""encouraging contributions toward the well-being of  humanity"".

Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad  when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should  go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't  comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at  all.  Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is  Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.  We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday  night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in  Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.  Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

Kay",mann-k
2289,"Scott,  Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is  optionality.  I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if  this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment  to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As  far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the  possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in  the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to  see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for  financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC  instead of messing with an assignment later.  I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what  we need to keep in mind.

2310,"Hi Scott,  I have some questions:  The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance  (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you  have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to  require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?  Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we  need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the  most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I  understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard  foundations (as opposed to a credit).   On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason  for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some  monitoring ability.  On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using  something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations,  perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.  Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact  payment?  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

I  agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk  for a performance problem.  Is the reference to the ""State"" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?  As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a  confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my  opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.

Perhaps language such as  ""an appropriate  payment security"" or other similar language can be utilized. Please be  assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a  corporate guaranty.

The  agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company  from chasing certain transactions without Enron.  Once we really know what we  are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the  exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?    FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on  Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the  general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.

2726,"	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs)  bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has  completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth.  	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay  talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for  bandwidth trading and broadband services.  	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent  expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still  basically ""an energy and broadband company,"" he said.  	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer  underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth  trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as  saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those  areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses.  	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same  amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading,  Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary.  	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in  emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's  standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and  bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said.  	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals  put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy  Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth  trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news,  msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made.  	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a  telecommunications network.  	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the  end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or  made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later.  	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York,  Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of  13 pooling points.  	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can  connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another,  facilitating bandwidth trading.  	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in  December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom  carriers.  	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract  value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company  handed out at the conference.

2727,"I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality  hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In  short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to  potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our  forms allow this.  I'm trying to include an exception for ""potential lenders and investors""  whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or  effective solution?

If we want  to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs  to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter  what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it  should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.   We'll need to run this back through Accounting.  I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add  the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back  through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.

2841,"Calif Pwr Woes Tuesday, September 12, 2000 08:15 AM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	(This article was originally published Monday)  	WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited  authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged  price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's  wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a  congressional panel Monday.  	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff  investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes  available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing  of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.  	""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction,  we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as  some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking  market-based rates or otherwise.""  	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under  the Federal Power Act.  	""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis.  Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as  authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,""  Hoecker testified.  	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we  have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of  the pending staff investigation.  	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San  Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its  retail customer base.  	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power  Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this  summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much  for power as they did a year ago.  	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis  	The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra  Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid  into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an  order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's  independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price  controls don't apply.  	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's  bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it  left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the  price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the  power exchange.  	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to  place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated  market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market  volatility.  	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer  transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations,  or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the  power-supply problem.  	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in  California because its experience with new market institutions such as power  exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.  	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California  in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,""  Hoecker noted.  	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is  in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale  markets,"" he said.  	""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the  lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.  	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market  structure.  	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their  electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price  risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left  consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said  officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news,  msgs).  	California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default  utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to  their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.

2874,"Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	By James Covert  	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading  rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE,  news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president  Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday.  	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling  said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the  power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely  not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said.  	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,""  which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices,  Skilling said.  	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and  South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said.  	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling  said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more  opportunities for someone who's playing across the board.""  	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher  per-unit rate of return, Skilling said.  	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in  building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals  may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies.  	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said,  referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities  around the clock.  	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated  commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape  of the market of that commodity.""  	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's  future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone.  	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there  are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on  any one geographic region as opposed to others.  	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000  megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's  possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach  markets like that.""  	-By James Covert, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;  james. ",mann-k

We have presented to People's  a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.   Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and  the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The  essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to  $25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial,  legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together  on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.  We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:  Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron  Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and  covered by our confidentiality agreement. Define term (5 years)   Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split  50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting  the engineering work kicked off.    We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.

I've previously been advised that Corp  performs this function.    Issues which arise: will the money be invested  overnight, who has signature authority, etc.  We have a draft services  agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you  need a separate doc.  2.2 (b)Billing/collection.  Responsibility generally should stop at sending  nastygrams.  No duty to hire lawyers, etc.  2.2 (f) Insurance.  In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance  and adjust claims.  Current language may be soft enough to not violate  licensing laws.  2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of  Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.  2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M  contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.  3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be  captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.   It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency  role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer  yet?  Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are  they on their own?   Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions  (sounds silly)?  Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?    3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to ""day  of"" transactions.    3.4  last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?

3068,"NEPCO's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.  Is this a  lump sum deal? If so, then I think NEPCO is taking an aggressive approach to  both LOL and retention.  A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period  is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit  of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another  factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE  contract.  Is NEPCO taking risk on GE performance, and is the dollar value of  the GE equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?  I'm glad to discuss this if I can be of help.

3205,"FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal  NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co.,  said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7  billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company.  The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27  billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and  $10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said.  The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies.  Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of  a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get  0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share.  Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at  its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed  Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8.  Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of  15-15/16.  SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED  The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal  regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within  15 months.  ``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy  companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J.  Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive.  Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company  while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman.  The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57  percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of  directors, the companies said.  Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110  million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating  duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs.  Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue  enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings  of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said.  FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the  merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts.  In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans,  together worth $1 billion. FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while  Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said.  ",mann-k

I suspect he would want AI and St. Paul to  agree in writing that this doesn't prejudice any rights/constitute a waiver,  etc.  You may have considered this already, but payment to /request for payment to  EEPC may trigger the responsibility to pay VAT.   Good luck, and keep me posted.    Kay",mann-k
3308,"Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.  I feel into marathon meeting mode  today.  Here are my observations of the GE contract.  I tried to confine it to  significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.  General Terms and Conditions I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for  performance/warranty issues.  Final payment is made at shipment, with the  Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond  expires at Provisional Acceptance.  There is no financial leverage for Final  Acceptance or the warranty period.  Also, usually provisional or final  acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.  The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.  I don't know the deal, so I  don't know how it fits. It can help to have language which allows for free  assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs  first.  Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment  security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.  Again, I don't know the deal so  this may be fine as is.  The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does  not give an order of precedence.  I haven't seen the proposal or any other  technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.  Therefore,  you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.  Warranty.  The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of  the 1st and 2nd paragraph.  Also, the ""outs"" they have are very broad.  It is  better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in  accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry  practice).  Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their  permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a  warranty claim.  A statement that they must provide a service engineer within  3 days or so might help.  I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to  warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty  problems need to be explicit.  Excusable Delay. (15) I would delete ""indirectly"" from the 3rd line.  Provisional Acceptance. I don't understand the phrase ""only to the extent and  proportional share"".  Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full  LD's, or that the buyer has to prove  a right to collect LD's?  Litigation. The dispute resolution (mediation then  litigation) is not  consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.  I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.  13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.  For instance, I  would delete or clarify the phrase ""including that due to environment or  operation"", as being vague.  13.6 (i)The phrase ""proper storage,  installation, operation and maintenance"" should be as defined by GE's written  instructions, or at least based on industry standards. 13.6 (ii) could  conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to  get someone else to do the work.  14.1  The last line should include the words ""strict liability"" after  ""negligence"". GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they  introduce.  This is a quick look.  If you need more detailed information (and you think  there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.  Kay",mann-k

Therefore, either WestLB  needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an  option agreement.  There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines;  however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.  Lisa advises that Transaction  Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.  I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples  tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the  Moore project off the balance sheet.

3399,"Hi Ben,  IMHO, your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting  issues.  Legal should have a bit more of a developed (and probably current)  understanding of how to address the issues.  Between Development and Legal,  we should be able to get docs about 90% there.  We then take the almost  compliant docs to Accting/Finance for fine tuning.    A key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good  download of information from Acct/Finance to the Development group.  We had  one yesterday for Legal, and it was helpful.  I want to sit in when your  troops get the presentation, if at all possible, because I can help translate  on both sides, I believe.  I also want to make sure that Development and  Legal are on the same page.  Fire drill avoidance is a key objective.  Look forward to discussing in detail.  Kay",mann-k

3401,"My understanding is that the ABB equipment will most likely be used somewhere  other than Calumet due to the noise issue.  It is possible that LM 6000's  will be used on Calumet, resulting in a re-bid of the EPC contract.

One alternative has been to buy gas from the City of Rocky Mount, which has a  take or pay contract with the local supplier, and is not using all of their  gas, especially in the summer.    We have developed a preliminary draft of the LOI, which I am attaching for  your review.

3458,"Nancy,  Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:  As a general note, we would have these goals:  1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in  the interconnection agreement. 2.  Minimize ties to specific unit. 3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points. 4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet. 5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.  More specifically we would like to:  Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement. Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for  now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be  determined. Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.  Comments on specific articles: Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement. 2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect. 2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial  operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term ""breach""  should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any  of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is  a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add  change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want  to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site  acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we  will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site. 3.4  Peak period is July and August. 3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.   Might just leave blanks as placeholders. 3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice. 3.5 (d) suggest title ""Start-Up Minimum Run Time"". 3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year.   Need a minimum shut down time between start ups. 4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to  the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it  throughout.  8.1 (c)  replace ""covenant"" with ""obligation"", and follow with ""(other than  payment)"". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.   8.1 (d) remove ""shall"" and conform grammar in romanettes. 8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass  the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8?  Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and  exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok? 9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an  invoice? 10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second ""Seller"" be ""Buyer""? 15.  No mediation. 16.1  Delete oral amendment language.  Exhibits: A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600.  Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source  energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.

I would suggest that we make  the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which  gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the  contracts immediately.  That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if  necessary.  If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the  ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days  of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the  contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui  can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui  bought in on the payment plan?  I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff.

3569,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:  1. Advantages to the single contract:  Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one. Better from a liability standpoint. Easier to administer.  Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?  2. Repayment/prepayment  I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.  3.  Assignment to Mitsui  Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested  payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the  assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE  contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.   Peggy is checking on this, also.  4. Parent guaranty.  GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft  contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the  current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment  to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider  inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after  execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if  necessary.

3582,"Hi Mike,  Sorry I missed you when you returned by call this am.  I have some concerns about the voice mail you left re: assignment language.   Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as  this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to  do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which  is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This  addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the  ""financial wherewithall"" to make the payments. This is a big change from  where we were in the last contract.   I've had a request to get an approximate storage cost (monthly) for budgetary  purposes.  This is in connection with the buy back arrangement.  Can you give  me a guesstimate?  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

Enron just opened a new parking garage, but  I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.  Alternatively,  the Allen  Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.

3854,"I wanted to review where I think we are in this transaction.  1. Escrow account. We are still awaiting  closure on the issue of the  lender's security interest in the escrow account.  A proposal was discussed  with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta  had defaulted under their loan arrangement.  Indications were that this  approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter  agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This  prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow  agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the  agreement.    2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these  were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.  3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested  by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts.   4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a  new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt  directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we  aren't involved in.  I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you  forward the draft change orders with it?  One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have  us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money),  retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are  putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and  since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be  acceptable to GE.    Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls  scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone ""quiet time"" to review  the contract.

I told them you were  talking to GE about it, and we will get them the contract ASAP.  Here are the issues:  If we terminate due to their default, they want the additional $5m to be  liquidated damages (ie, our exclusive remedy).  They still want the right to talk to GE, specifically about the terms of the  assignment to the LLC if we are having difficulty getting GE consent.  They want to be able to exercise their call (or take an assignment) of the  turbine contract earlier.  They are willing to take the risk with the GE  warranties.  This is a relationship issue.  It is also their biggest issue.  On an interesting note, Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer  of all the equipment to Sweetgum. Do you know if Lee knows about this?    Ciao,  Kay ",mann-k

Carlos will assist with the coordination of the finance and  accounting requirements.  Due to the complexity of the issues some lead time  is necessary.  Unfortunately, there are no ""forms"" for generation projects  (given accounting/finance requirements), or any assurance that a contract  that worked a month ago will work now.   My preference is that contracts not be sent to counterparties prior to ENA  (or EECC) Legal review.  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

4093,"When we were part of Julia's group, waivers of consequentials in CA's were  not standard. I don't know if this was due to an ENA policy (doubtful).   If we are the one giving important information, we shouldn't want to waive  it automatically, because consequentials will be the most likely result of  the other party's breach. Therefore, in unilateral agreements where we are  giving the info, I wouldn't want the waiver.  In the reciprocals it would  depend on the circumstance.  If the other party is doing most of the sharing,  I would want it.  What say you, Carlos?   Kay",mann-k

4599,"Nancy,  Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:  As a general note, we would have these goals:  1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in  the interconnection agreement. 2.  Minimize ties to specific unit. 3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points. 4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet. 5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.  More specifically we would like to:  Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement. Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for  now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be  determined. Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.  Comments on specific articles: Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement. 2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect. 2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial  operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term ""breach""  should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any  of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is  a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add  change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want  to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site  acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we  will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site. 3.4  Peak period is July and August. 3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.   Might just leave blanks as placeholders. 3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice. 3.5 (d) suggest title ""Start-Up Minimum Run Time"". 3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year.   Need a minimum shut down time between start ups. 4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to  the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it  throughout.  8.1 (c)  replace ""covenant"" with ""obligation"", and follow with ""(other than  payment)"". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.   8.1 (d) remove ""shall"" and conform grammar in romanettes. 8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass  the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8?  Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and  exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok? 9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an  invoice? 10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second ""Seller"" be ""Buyer""? 15.  No mediation. 16.1  Delete oral amendment language.  Exhibits: A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600.  Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source  energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.  Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any  questions/issues.  Please let me know your availability.  Thanks,  Kay ",mann-k

4662,"Hi guys,  In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:  1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel  Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know  this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the  construction activities.  2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple  contracts. Does anyone care?  3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail  the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a  proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full  reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up  the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel  cells failing to perform?   Thanks,  Kay ",mann-k

4721,Sounds good to me.,mann-k
4722,"Hi Scott,  I have some questions:  The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance  (ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you  have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to  require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?  Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we  need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the  most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I  understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard  foundations (as opposed to a credit).   On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason  for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some  monitoring ability.  On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using  something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations,  perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.  Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact  payment?  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

4725,If it is ok with you I'll let you know in a little bit.    ,mann-k
4726,"More questions:  We have two different levels of guarantee values.  We have the specific  performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.  This  includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and  discharge).  Will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that  FCE will have to work to try to fix?  I'm assuming there are no sound  issues.    Thanks again,  Kay",mann-k

4743,"Scott,  Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is  optionality.  I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if  this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment  to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As  far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the  possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in  the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to  see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for  financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC  instead of messing with an assignment later.  I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what  we need to keep in mind.

4750,"Hi Charlotte,  I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.  Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two  antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get  these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael   isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad  when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should  go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't  comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at  all.  Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is  Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.  We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday  night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in  Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.  Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

4751,"That would be great.  We can leave his ""stuff"" by the front door.  I know he  will have things he wants to bring to show you.  Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ( ).

I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.   Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing  docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?

I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which  were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing  to tell you how much I enjoyed it.  I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the  indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was  beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children  present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there  were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the  first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother  to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring  Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't  offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at  intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.  Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion.

4850,"Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	(Corrected 1:59 pm) 	 	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules  proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron  Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was  discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said.  	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to  300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron  said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator  projects with the California Independent System Operator.  	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price  setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become  a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from  the public, or it could be modified.  	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the  ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a  total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for  installing the new generators, which the power companies will own.  	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the  generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the  power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered  CalPX.  	""There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost  associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital  commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"" Enron's Mark Palmer said.  	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed  concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects.  	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of  California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were  three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand  for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more  than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights  on.

4879,"Off the internet:   	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend  	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000--  	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants  	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of  contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R)  (DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract  is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)  National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and  operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison  Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for  $100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in  Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using  methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter  of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA.  	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions  	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction  project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using  coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs  for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell  Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing  emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced  by using a fuel that is essentially free.  	   said Leitman.  	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high  efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through  combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of  producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less  noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process.  	About FuelCell Energy, Inc.  	FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a  leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power  generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel  processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a  product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and  reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation.  FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power  plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been  developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S.  Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory  (NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on  developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate  clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the  customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and  industrial applications.

On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an  ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew  this).  I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal;  I don't know about the Choc. Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA  projects.   Maybe these are sleepers.

I would have sent  this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.  Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to  get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them  contractually allocated to various projects.

4963,"Scott,  As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's  group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my  understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as  you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We  can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to  questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access  the resources in their group, however.  FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for  you to look at.  As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is  too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent.  Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring  a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing  facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell  their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something  peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.  Kay",mann-k

I  haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket  items:  Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.  Enron owns equity and holds warrants for  Fuel Cell stock.  We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the  benefit of the warrants.  The commercial team is  working on a deal to place  50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.  I  have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently  completed the LOI with CRRA.  We need to move to more definitive docs with  CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete. The decision about whether the  state will fund the project is expected in December.  This deal is likely to  continue to take up a large amount of  my time, and requires a fair amount of  travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.  This transaction is on Dave  D and Janet D's radar screen, and  Mark is familiar with it.  The potential  upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.  Turbopark.  Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects.   Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.

4975,"Lisa,  Thank you for the timely comments.  Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company  partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds  an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past  with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are  different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have  received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are  ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have  received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each  ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.  Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to  capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in  order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we  addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work  performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make  the effective date a current one.   Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest  option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since  the data sheets have changed.    Hope this was helpful.  Kay",mann-k

5201,"Fuel cells kindle investor energy By Beverly Goodman Redherring.com, November 27, 2000  Companies with no earnings. Market capitalizations in the billions even  though revenue hovers in the tens of millions. Analyst optimism bordering on  the feverish. We know -- this probably sounds all too familiar. But this time  we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations. We're  talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear  source of future revenue. We're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly  efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity.  And while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the  pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at Red Herring expect  that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time. Investors  more interested in companies that sell dog food over the Internet can stop  reading here. There's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they  provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than  traditional generating sources (see Trend No. 9: Energy, December 4). Most  only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as  by-products, both of which are reusable. Simply put, fuel cells consist of  hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst. Typically, the fuel cell is  heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity. Since nothing  is burned, no pollutants are created. In time, proponents say, fuel cells  will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that  manufacture them. During this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices,  fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment.  Stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in  the last 12 months. That's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit  they took in the spring. The Nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent  since last November. Investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of IPOs. H Power (Nasdaq:  HPOW), Millennium Cell (Nasdaq: MCEL), and Proton Energy Systems (Nasdaq:  PRTN) all went public within the past few months. While those IPOs may seem  to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole  picture. ""We're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"" says  William Fogel, a power technology analyst for First Albany. ""The deregulation  in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is  in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an Internet-based  economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an  increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the  combustion engine."" Admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so  profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies. But investors have  proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become  mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations. (Still  holding JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq: JDSU)?) With early-stage fuel cell technology  due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers  within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing)  curve. CELL DIVISION The fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary,  portable, residential, and automotive. Fuel cells will likely hit the large  stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to  David Redstone, editor of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Investor newsletter.  ""We're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"" he says, noting that fuel  cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential  energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out). Fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80  percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent  efficiency. The leading developer of these stationary cells is Fuelcell  Energy (Nasdaq: FCEL) (FCE), which is poised to be the first to commercialize  them in 2001. At first blush, FCE's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months  and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50  stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap. But using a variety of  metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and  discounted 2006 revenue, Lehman Brothers analyst Maureen Murphy considers FCE  undervalued by 40 percent. Using a projected market value of five times  estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5  percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124. Portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are  also expected to be commercialized soon. Ballard Power Systems (Nasdaq: BLDP ), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly  all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel  cell-powered generator to market in 2001. ""They don't make promises they're  not able to keep,"" says Christine Farkas, a senior specialist and director at  Merrill Lynch. ""They've never disappointed."" Ballard has also made  significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of Xcellsis,  a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with DaimlerChrysler (NYSE:  DCX) and Ford Motor (NYSE: F). Analysts expect Ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004,  and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265. Still, Ballard's  involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads Ms. Farkas to  expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to  approximately $2.2 billion in net income. Applying a multiple of 25 to those  earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock  price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices. INDUSTRY REVOLUTION Even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion  has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive  sectors. Ford chairman William Clay Ford Jr. declared at the 2000 Detroit  Auto Show, ""Longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the  internal combustion engine."" Legislation such as California's mandate that by  2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on  alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance. While not a pure-play on fuel cells, Impco Technologies is well positioned to  see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel  delivery, storage, and power electronics systems. Mr. Fogel expects Impco's  products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5  billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010. (Its much more down-to-earth P/S  ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in  Impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the  alternative fuel industry.) ""They're involved with almost every aspect of  General Motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and  implementation efforts,"" Mr. Fogel says. Impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent  off its March 6 high of $52. But by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006  earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, Mr. Fogel  arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a  conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects. Mr. Fogel  sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to  return to its high in the coming 12 months. Despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will  inevitably be setbacks. Take, for example, Plug Power (Nasdaq: PLUG), which  ran out of gas when General Electric (NYSE: GE), which owns one-third of a  joint venture with Detroit Edison (NYSE: DTA) and Plug, decided to change  course. Plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a  price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell  powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid. Instead, GE now  wants to develop a ""grid parallel"" system, which would work in tandem with  the existing system. That news, coupled with management woes and Nasdaq  turbulence, sent Plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on March 13  to $16.50 on November 24. It will take all the energy fuel cells can generate  to get that stock back on track.

5220,"Hi Carolyn,  Here are my intial comments on the letter agreement and LLC:  1.  Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the  transformer as well as the turbine?  2.  Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload  responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the  equipment, not just the sale.  I believe this should be a TEH responsibility.  3.  Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and  commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a  reference is fine).  4.  Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the  confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement?  If fact, please review  the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss  same.  5.  Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here.  We should  specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed  by a credit worthy entity.    6.  Timing of delivery of contract and funding -  in discussing this matter  with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the  obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility  agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to  fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing.  7.  Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to  convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the  nitty gritty of our financing structure.  I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of  where we are headed.  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k
5221,"As soon as I hit the ""send"" button I recalled another issue.  Enron does not  want the LLC used for anything other than the  acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.

The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe  units 17 & 18.  These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the  base prices of each will be increased appropriately.  We will pay 75% of the  price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will  be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option.  The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS:  CA Energy  Development I, LLC  and CA Energy Development II, LLC.

5578,"Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question  concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and  assumption agreement.  The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being  subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent  problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has  coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened  until there is a certainty of closing.  A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I  will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this  transaction.  We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement,  based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark  transaction.    I'll make the changes.

She is the ultimate  micro-manager.  She may hire the outside counsel on ""your"" deal, then tell  you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use.    This style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working  closely with someone.  Clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and  she is very, very nice.

Here are the highlights from  our conversation:  Enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without  putting the Moore project on the balance sheet.  Therefore, either WestLB  needs to enter into the agreement with Peoples or Enron can enter into an  option agreement.  There is room in the WestLB facility for the turbines;  however, RAC needs to approve the purchase.  Lisa advises that Transaction  Support (Herman or Roger) needs to buy in as well.  I understand we would like to present a binding agreement to Peoples  tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the  Moore project off the balance sheet.   I'm available to discuss this.  Lisa advises that she will be in tomorrow as  well.  Lisa, please correct me if any of this is not accurate.  Kay   ",mann-k

We also need a Best rating of A-XIII or better.  Also, we need a specific reference to the fact that the new member will be  responsible for the insurance required in article 19.2 of the turbine  contract.  The certificate of insurance should be a buyer deliverable at  closing.  Would it be better to address our ability to put the member interest to them  on or before [some date- maybe Dec 02], just to get it on the table?   Term- I'm thinking we may want to be indemnified for longer than 60 days  after commercial ops, as a claim could be brought against us for something  they did (and for which we should be indemnified) for longer than that, but  we would be out of luck, except to the extent insurance took care of it.   Maybe we should address reps/warranties separate from indemnities, with the  indemnities lasting longer.  I'd make the confidentiality agreement last for 2  years in this deal.  I'd broaden 9 (xii) to include the acquisition of the equipment, not just the  facility agreement.  14.  I would reformulate 14 to negotiate around the statement that the  equipment is being acquired from ENA.  I would also eliminate ""or any other  third party"" on the fifth line.

6072,"	Antitrust Division Won't Challenge Electricity Distribution Cooperative  WASHINGTON (BNA) -- A proposal by 17 rural Arkansas electric power  distribution cooperatives that would allow them to market electric power to  retail customers passes antitrust muster, according to a Jan. 10 business  review letter by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, which could  find no lessening of competition in any electric power market.  The distribution cooperatives are 17 nonprofit cooperative corporations  formed under the Electric Cooperative Corporation Act of Arkansas to provide  electric service predominantly to rural consumers.  Each distribution cooperative is owned by the individual member/consumers  that it serves and is legally obligated to distribute annually all its income  to its member/customers.  Due to the 1999 enactment of the Electric Consumer Choice Act, which mandates  competition in the retail sale of electricity beginning as early as Jan. 1,  2002, the manner of selling and buying retail electricity within Arkansas  will change greatly. Consumers now purchase electricity only from the  regulated electric utility serving the territory in which the consumer is  located. Under the Act, a consumer will be allowed to purchase electric  energy from any entity in the competitive marketplace, and the consumer's  incumbent utility will have to deliver that electricity to the consumer's  door under regulated distribution charges.  The new legislation's primary focus is the separation of the retail marketing  activities--which will be completely competitive--from the electric utility's  regulated transmission and distribution activities. To ensure that the  utility's marketing operations do not benefit improperly from its  relationship with the utility, the Act provides that employees engaged in the  transmission and distribution system operations are required to function  independently of employees engaged in the marketing or sale of electricity at  retail.  The act creates an obligation for each incumbent utility to offer a standard  service package to any consumer who has not been willing or able to secure an  alternative energy service provider. Distribution cooperatives, under the  act, may serve these consumers, referred to as default consumers, directly or  they may assign them to an affiliate. The rates for the standard service  package will be a market rate, unless the incumbent utility chooses to offer  a regulated rate approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission.  The proposal advanced by the distribution cooperatives would enable them to  create a joint venture to market electric power to retail customers  throughout Arkansas. All retail marketing activities outside the traditional  local territories of the distribution cooperatives would be conducted through  the joint marketing venture. If a distribution cooperative decides to  withdraw from the joint venture, it may compete with the joint venture for  any and all consumers.  The proposal provides that each distribution cooperative would decide  individually whether to serve its default customers directly or to assign its  default customers to the joint venture.  Each distribution cooperative has a relatively small amount of the electric  power generating capacity in Arkansas, and the combined generating power  capacity of the 17 distribution cooperatives is approximately 6 percent of  the total generating capacity in the two areas of Arkansas in which the joint  venture is likely to market.  The joint venture is expected to achieve economies of scale that would give  it significantly lower distribution costs in statewide or regional markets  than would be attainable by individual members.   Procompetitive Effects  In the business review letter, Acting Assistant Attorney General A. Douglas  Melamed indicated that the proposed joint retail marketing venture does not  appear to have any anticompetitive effect.  He commented that ""while the distribution cooperatives could be viewed as  potential entrants into each other's local retail markets, regional markets  and a state-wide market, their small size and relatively high operating costs  make it unlikely that they could enter new markets on their own or that, if  they tried to enter, they would offer effective competition.""  Melamed added that ""the existence of other, larger potential entrants into  [the local retail markets] would significantly diminish, if not eliminate,  any anticompetitive effect that might otherwise result from the joint venture  proposal. It seems at least as likely, if not more so, that the joint retail  marketing proposal would have the procompetitive effect of creating an  additional entrant into retail markets not currently served by the  distribution cooperatives.""  The business review letter is available at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/--the  Antitrust Division's Web site-- and a file containing the business review  request and the division's response may be examined in the Antitrust  Documents Group of the Antitrust Division, Suite 215, Liberty Place, 325 7th  St., N.W., Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20004.

ENA Legal represents the interests of  advises the origination and  development team (and other members of ENA management as appropriate) on all  legal aspects of a transaction, accessing internal and external resources as  required. and reviews/synthesizes comments from the all the groups.    3. ENA Legal works with origination team, Accounting, Global Finance and Tax  in structuring the transaction, and communicates with EECC (and others) as  required during the execution of the project to faciliate compliance with the  structure.   Recommendations for improving the interaction between EE&CC and ENA: 1. EE&CC Legal should be involved in the beginning of the process of drafting  documents by EE&CC Contract Administration, unless other procedures have been  agreed.   2. Due to conflicts of interest, EE&CC Legal cannot represent NEPCO  while at  the same time working with the deal team. to procure equipment for the same  project. ENA Legal and EECC Legal should be advised early in the process of  any project-related agreements being generated by EECC, so that compliance  with overall deal structure and risk profile can be ascertained. 3. Comments returned to EE&CC  need to either be incorporated in the next  draft, or if there are issues on the comments, they need to be discussed with  the ENA Legal representative or Origination contact, prior to distribution to  vendors. 4. EECC Legal and ENA Legal should communicate regarding issues common to  both companies so that consistency in position can be achieved as much as  possible.  Forms of ""standard"" agreements should be discussed/agreed to  enhance consistency. 5. Service and consulting agreements not specific to a particular transaction  which can be untilized by multiple Enron companies via tasking letters should  be prepared by EECC.  EECC should provide information concerning the  existence of such service agreements. 6.

6186,"Per Barbara's request, here's a summary of much of what I'm working on:  Co Op City asset management arrangement:  In this deal, Enron would build a  small power generation facility for a housing co op in the Bronx, Co Op  City.  We would arrange for O & M services, supply the fuel (primarily gas),  market their excess power, and, for the first 4 years, take 1/2 the offtake.   We are currently working to structure the transaction to keep if off the  balance sheet and maximize the mark.  We are working on  a term sheet, and I  will be in NYC later this week to continue negotations with the customer.   Mark Bernstein is the originator, Debbie Chance is the developer, and NEPCO  Houston is  involved.  I discussed outside counsel with Jeff, and I would  like to use John Klauberg at LeBeouf.    Sell of two development projects in Illinois.  Two of the sites we have  developed (sans equipment) are up for sale, and Fred Mitro has contacted me  about supporting the transaction.  Lisa Mellencamp had previously contacted  Bracewell about working on it, but I'm a little concerned about the amount of  experience of the person they have designated.  I've asked Clark Thompson for  some information on his background.    SW 501d - our claim against SWestinghouse, and possible sale of the  equipment.  We have issues with the vendor concerning the late delivery of  this equipment.  We are also trying to sell the equipment (a  turbine/generator set) to Calpine.    Fuel Cells - last year Enron made a $5million investment in Fuel Cells, a  company which is developing an almost green form of power generation.  We  received contingent warrants which we can cash in if we arrange for 55 mw.   We are working with an instrumentality of the state of Connecticut about them  buying 26 megawatts. We are working on the purchase agreement with FC, and  the project development agreement with the State.  It is quiet right now, as  funding is figured out.  There's TurboPark maintenance stuff which pops up weekly.  GE - Sheila and I have a weekly phone conference with GE to work on a  standard contract for buying turbines.  I've heard a rumor that we will be  buying some more, although neither Sheila nor I have been contacted yet.    I think this is a fair summary of the big ticket items.  Kay",mann-k

6226,"Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.  I feel into marathon meeting mode  today.  Here are my observations of the GE contract.  I tried to confine it to  significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.  General Terms and Conditions I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for  performance/warranty issues.  Final payment is made at shipment, with the  Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond  expires at Provisional Acceptance.  There is no financial leverage for Final  Acceptance or the warranty period.  Also, usually provisional or final  acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.  The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.  I don't know the deal, so I  don't know how it fits. It can help to have language which allows for free  assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs  first.  Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment  security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.  Again, I don't know the deal so  this may be fine as is.  The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does  not give an order of precedence.  I haven't seen the proposal or any other  technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.  Therefore,  you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.  Warranty.  The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of  the 1st and 2nd paragraph.  Also, the ""outs"" they have are very broad.  It is  better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in  accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry  practice).  Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their  permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a  warranty claim.  A statement that they must provide a service engineer within  3 days or so might help.  I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to  warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty  problems need to be explicit.  Excusable Delay. (15) I would delete ""indirectly"" from the 3rd line.  Provisional Acceptance. I don't understand the phrase ""only to the extent and  proportional share"".  Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full  LD's, or that the buyer has to prove  a right to collect LD's?  Litigation. The dispute resolution (mediation then  litigation) is not  consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.  I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.  13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.  For instance, I  would delete or clarify the phrase ""including that due to environment or  operation"", as being vague.  13.6 (i)The phrase ""proper storage,  installation, operation and maintenance"" should be as defined by GE's written  instructions, or at least based on industry standards. 13.6 (ii) could  conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to  get someone else to do the work.  14.1  The last line should include the words ""strict liability"" after  ""negligence"". GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they  introduce.  This is a quick look.  If you need more detailed information (and you think  there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.  Kay",mann-k

I need to set priorities, so it would help to know what's  most important, especially since I'm on the road.

6300,"Here's what Eric wrote:   I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes  are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3  as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to  exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.  Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to  your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I  therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a  separate word file.   Exhibit F is ""boiler plate"" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit ""U"" is not in my  hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit ""T.""   If you get something from  GE on Exhibit ""U"", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  ",mann-k

John Schwartzenburg was out of town, but went  out of his way to accommodate my request so that by Thursday evening, I had a  form from EECC. I worked over the weekend to adapt the form to this project,  and forwarded it to EECC on Monday.  I received no response to the revised  draft.

6419,"Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a  Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself  as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure?  Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types  of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.  Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on  modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider  where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size,  the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or  better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too.  Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with  electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes  braking power during a panic stop).  Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to  meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood  of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 rpm and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at  4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i).  The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a  2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The  four-speed automatic transmission provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on  slippery surfaces.  With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully  independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle  tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle  Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and  is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's  steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck  (car?) back under control.  In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects  occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point  seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR),  front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat  anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.  Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear  60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded.  Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control,  tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard.

6421,"		  		 		 		?EDMUNDS' REVIEW 		 		Nissan's hardy Pathfinder has always been our vehicle of choice for seeking a  new path to the premium outlet center. Though the exterior may exude that  tough-guy outdoorsy image, the interior has always been comfortable enough  for the dilettante woodsman who doesn't like to get his nails too dirty.  Though the old 3.3-liter V6 engine provided acceptable levels of low-end  grunt, the coarsely produced 170 horsepower it made was meager when stacked  against newer competitors.  		So revel, all you who seek liberation from urban ennui -- the Pathfinder is  finally energized by a stouter V6, based on the Maxima sedan's stellar  powerplant. When mated to a five-speed manual transmission, the 3.5-liter,  DOHC V6 engine produces a mighty 250 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of  torque. Matching it to an automatic tranny will usurp 10 ponies but add 25  foot-pounds of twist, still ample power to haul plenty of equipment and go  mountain climbing, as well as merge onto freeways without fear.  		The Pathfinder comes with rear-wheel or part-time four-wheel drive, the  latter of which provides a shift-on-the-fly transfer case that can be engaged  at speeds up to 50 mph. On LE models, an automatic All-Mode four-wheel-drive  system can be specified for 2001, giving you one more reason to skip paying  the extra tariff the Infiniti QX4 commands. All-Mode operates in 2WD,  automatic 4WD, 4WD-Hi and 4WD-Lo, all selected using a simple rotary knob on  the dashboard.  		We've long admired the Pathfinder for its excellent ride and handling,  further enhanced by solid unibody construction. The interior, one of the  friendliest of any SUV on the market, is spruced up for 2001 with an updated  instrument panel. A new dual level center console with a padded armrest and  12-volt power source will organize all your gewgaws.  		You can choose from three trim levels -- the XE, which for the 2001 model  year comes with standard power windows, mirrors and locks, and a security  system; the sporty SE, which gives you a choice of automatic or manual  transmission along with sporty trim; and the top-of-the-line LE, which  includes fog lights, Bose audio system, and fake wood accents.  		All models come standard with 16-inch wheels, full-size spare tire, a CD  player and ABS. Side airbags can be ordered as long as they are contained in  leather-wrapped seating, which is available only on SE and LE. Those same  models, when power is transferred to the drive wheels via an automatic  transmission, can be equipped with a mobile entertainment system, which  includes a 6.4-inch flip-down LCD screen, video player, and ports to plug and  play a PlayStation 2 (And we all know how important that will be after  Christmas, don't we?). A ""Birdview"" navigation system, shared with the  Infiniti QX4, is also available, but we don't recommend it. While the  ""Birdview"" perspective is interesting, teensy, tiny, little, itty-bitty  buttons control the thing, along with some of the climate control functions.  Get a map.  		Items that remain static from last year include a substantial maximum cargo  carrying capacity of 85 cubic feet (surprising for what appears to be a  relatively small vehicle). Some of this space, in our humble opinion, should  have been used to alleviate the still-cramped rear accommodations.  		Despite a few quibbles, we're thrilled that Nissan finally rectified the  Pathfinder's main problem -- horsepower. With this updated, competitive  package, we're betting fat rebates and dealer incentives have gone the way of  the Dodo. ",mann-k

I felt this was too broad of a carve out, especially from the  contractor's point of view.   Any tweaking of the indemnity language (to  blatantly reconcile it with the waiver) can occur during the drafting process.  Just wanted to pass this along.  Kay ",mann-k

6529,"Mercury's Mountaineer debuted several years ago as an upscale version of the  best-selling Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle. The problem was, Ford's  Explorer could be just as luxurious as the Mountaineer and, in some cases,  was even more expensive. For 2002, Mercury has attempted to further  distinguish their sport-ute from the popular Explorer. The result is a fine  SUV, with improved handling characteristics and generous feature content.  This near-luxury sport-ute comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210  horsepower or a 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines come mated  to a five-speed automatic transmission. The new V8 offers copious and refined  power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers.  Mountaineer has been redesigned inside and out, and the results are pleasing.  Now easily distinguishable from the Explorer from the A-pillars forward, its    theme makes use of a satin-finish grille and bold headlamps.  Meanwhile, the interior gets satin-aluminum trim accents, lending a  distinctive, high-tech flavor to this former Explorer clone.  Improvements to the Mountaineer are much more than cosmetic, however. An  all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame  design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches -  thereby making room for a third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance  to 9.2 inches. At the same time, ride and handling have been dramatically  improved. The Mountaineer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits  flatter cornering characteristics. A 2.5-inch wider stance improves handling  even more, while increasing interior room.  Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) have also been improved in the 2002  Mountaineer. A 50-percent reduction of air leakage into the truck's cabin and  a refined automatic transmission make for a more serene driving environment,  although some vibration from the available all-wheel-drive system does  intrude through the floor.  New convenience features in the Mountaineer include a standard six-way power  adjustable driver's seat, along with optional adjustable pedals, heated front  seats and heated exterior mirrors. Among the Mountaineer's new safety  features are optional side curtain airbags, a stiffer body shell and a lower  front bumper for improved crash compatibility with other vehicles. Later in  the model year, rollover protection sensors, and a new AdvanceTrac  traction/stability control system will also be available.  The Mountaineer's strengths lie in its feature content, powerful engine  choices and improved rear suspension. There are plenty of SUVs on the market,  but if you want an Explorer, yet can't stomach the thought of owning the  golden retriever of sport-utility vehicles, the Mountaineer just might float  your boat.

When we priced  these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the wood package  instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount the options by a  third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get reasonable over these  options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to ""work on it"".  The fellow  you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.

Closing date should be at least five but no more than 10 business days.  2  (a)  Facility Agreement is probably the more appropriate concept than Turbine  Contract.  Not a big issue if anyone disagrees with this terminology.  3. Make the guaranty for this agreement and the LLC agreement.   5 (d)  change 1st ""shall"" to ""'may"".  7 (b) does this make sense?  Should we also have the right to specific  performance?  9.  (iii) consents won't necessarily be obtained at the time of the signing  of the letter agreement.

We can get organized on putting together a  package of the next traunche of docs, such as the parent guaranty, escrow  agreement, etc.   Thanks,  Kay  PS.

6710,"Neither have us have spoken to GE.  I think Sheila spoke to Lee, but I don't  know the substance of the conversation.  We asked his permission  on the  Intergen deal, I believe.  I told Jake last night that there are arguments  which can be made on both sides as to whether GE needed too consent to having  the contract distributed to a potential partner.  He said he wanted to talk  to you about it.  My suggestion would be that someone on the commercial side discuss the  general status, and ask if it is ok to send out a redacted contract.  That is  the most conservative approach.  Kay",mann-k

I  know in previous deals the GE frame guys have agreed that we could give three  redacted copies to suitors, and the real one to THE ONE.  I think a casual  conversation will work.  The guarantees are nothing special, although the LD  ramp rates sometimes matter.  Lastly is delivery, but again, I don't think it  will be a big issue.  Maybe if Jake knows that he probably won't have to tell Lee who the suitors  are, that might help.  Kay",mann-k

Yes, it is CA Development III, only it is called  Salmon somethingorother llc.    I anticipate that the most recent version of the LV Co Gen contract will need  to be adapted to the CA form - no E Next Generation or ENA as agent.  I  believe Dale has been working on some tweaks to the form you last worked on  for LV Co Gen, and I assume these tweaks belong in the ""new"" Salmon  contract.  I will forward you the most current form that I've seen, and Dale  can protest if he thinks this is the wrong one to work with.  Carlos Sole  is  the lawyer in Houston who will be herding these cats.  His number is 713 345  8191.

I'll be glad to do it, although I don't suggest  bugging the other parties' counsel too much.  It uses up relationship  capital, and it causes the counterparty to incur expenses they may not want  to incur.    Another FYI -  I don't much like Enron commercial folks calling Enron outside  counsel unless we've discussed it in advance.  It violates Enron policy.

6998,"I had a brief conversation with Herman Manis, and he tells me that there is a  different interpretation of accounting rules relating to power plants.   Strangely enough, the change is one which should (I hope I hope) make power  development projects easier.  In the past, we ran into problems anytime we  wanted to build a power plant and take megawatts off of it.  Herman tells me  that the current interpretation now focuses on the operation and maintenance  of the plants, and not the power purchase agreement relating to the plant.   This change in focus should make power development deals easier to  structure.    I would still like to set up an Intro to TurboPark meeting with Rose  Engeldorf.  Rose is currently involved in a push a couple of deals in the  West this week, so it may be a bit before we can get it set up.  A meeting  with Herman would also be helpful.

I've got several  deals going great guns, so you know how that goes. I had lunch with Stuart  and Kathleen today, and that was fun.  Neil and I have a date night tomorrow,  so we are trying to decide what to do.  I suggested we just walk around the  downtown hot spots, if the weather is nice.  I've got diamond seat tickets for next Tuesday's opener.  I'm going to tell  Ben that I have female problems and have to go to the gyno so he will leave  me alone.  I figure if that doesn't do it, nothing will.  Neil gets to go  with me, which is really nice.  It is a 4 o'clock game, which I think is a  neat time.  Daylight savings time starts next week, so I guess the sun will  be setting as the game ends.  I'm glad baseball season is back, although I  did gave away our tickets to tomorrow's game.  Carlos and his wife waited around all day to be called in to go to the  hospital so she could be induced.  Texas Women's was too busy to take them.   They finally called them in at 700 tonight to come in, so I guess they will  have a late night.  You bottle of bubbly is in my kitchen.  I keep hoping to have an hour to  bring it by.  I figure it will be good  no matter when you get it.  My transfer to Power Trading is back on.  I think some of the work I do is  transferring with me, but I'm not sure.  In short, I don't know what the  difference will be.  It isn't supposed to happen until May, so I'm not giving  it too much thought.

7277,"FPL, Entergy Merge in $7 Billion Deal  NEW YORK (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc., the parent of Florida Power & Light Co.,  said on Monday it would merge with Entergy Corp. in a stock deal worth $7  billion to create the largest U.S. power generating company.  The combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27  billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and  $10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said.  The merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies.  Under the terms of the agreement, FPL shareholders would receive one share of  a new holding company for each FPL share held. Entergy shareholders would get  0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each Entergy share.  Based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value Entergy at  its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share. FPL shares closed  Friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8.  Entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of  15-15/16.  SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL REQUIRED  The combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal  regulators. FPL and Entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within  15 months.  ``The merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy  companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said J.  Wayne Leonard, Entergy chief executive.  Leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company  while FPL's chief executive, James Broadhead, will serve as chairman.  The deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives FPL shareholders 57  percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of  directors, the companies said.  Once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110  million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating  duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs.  Competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue  enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings  of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said.  FPL and Entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the  merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts.  In addition, both FPL and Entergy have authorized stock buyback plans,  together worth $1 billion. FPL plans to repurchase $570 million shares while  Entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said.  ",mann-k

7323,"Hi Ben,  The conference call went fine with NorthWestern.  They really want to get  their hands on the contract and the change orders.  I told them you were  talking to GE about it, and we will get them the contract ASAP.  Here are the issues:  If we terminate due to their default, they want the additional $5m to be  liquidated damages (ie, our exclusive remedy).  They still want the right to talk to GE, specifically about the terms of the  assignment to the LLC if we are having difficulty getting GE consent.  They want to be able to exercise their call (or take an assignment) of the  turbine contract earlier.  They are willing to take the risk with the GE  warranties.  This is a relationship issue.  It is also their biggest issue.  On an interesting note, Intergen wants you to sign a consent to the transfer  of all the equipment to Sweetgum. Do you know if Lee knows about this?    Ciao,  Kay ",mann-k

They understand that we are working  some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.   I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I  will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want  to mull it over.  They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you  forward the draft change orders with it?  One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have  us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money),  retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are  putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and  since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be  acceptable to GE.    Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls  scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone ""quiet time"" to review  the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it.   We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.  Kay ",mann-k

A travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.  That is what  business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years I've been flying  around North America, South America and Europe.  I've had good agents and bad  ones.

A proposal was discussed  with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta  had defaulted under their loan arrangement.  Indications were that this  approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter  agreement concerning this approach.  This has not yet been received.  This  prevents the establishment of the escrow account.  We have sent the escrow  agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the  agreement.    2. GE turbine contract.  Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these  were forwarded to GE.  I have not received a response from GE.  3.  Miscellaneous docs.  Enron has responded to all the documents requested  by Hancock.  We are awaiting responses to our drafts.   4.  GE consent.  Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a  new letter agreement.  GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.  GE has dealt  directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we  aren't involved in.  I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.

I realized that we have a disclaimer at the end of  the letter, but the statement in III seems to directly contradict the  disclaimer.  I am not confident that the statement that the Enron structure is proprietary  is sufficient to protect the information.  I will need to check the  confidentiality agreement when I get to the office if this is a real  concern.    I thought we weren't submitting a conforming bid.  Is there anything in the  RFP which indicates that any proposal will be considered a firm offer, or  anything to that effect?  Talk to you soon,  Kay",mann-k

I spoke with John  about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting  the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for  a transaction.

Lots of the streets downtown are under construction, so I'm a little  hesitant to give directions.  Enron is located fairly close to the Hyatt, and  their garage is easy to find.  Enron just opened a new parking garage, but  I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.  Alternatively,  the Allen  Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.  If it was me and I was working and staying downtown, I would take a taxi.   This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction, and  partly because of the construction downtown.

Evidently, the gas company has figured this out, and is not happy with this  prospect.  We would like your opinion concerning the City's ability to (a)  require that a tap be made so that the power plant be served and (b) sell gas  to Enron for this purpose.  When considering these issues, please assume that  the City would own and annex the land, and lease it to an Enron entity.  We will need the gas by next March or April, so time is critical.  Should the  gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be  expected to take?  Do you  have any suggestions for expediting the process?

Chris is on vacation, ciaoing down in Italy (sorry,  couldn't resist).  He should be the point man, though.  On the Delta deal we ran into some complications in moving money because  Citibank had the money invested in a money market account.  Does the current  draft allow for that?

EECC Legal uses Word.  I always  figured this WordPerfect thing was intentional, which is why I had  WordPerfect loaded on my computer.

7836,"Hi Ben,  IMHO, your team needs a basic understanding of the finance and accounting  issues.  Legal should have a bit more of a developed (and probably current)  understanding of how to address the issues.  Between Development and Legal,  we should be able to get docs about 90% there.  We then take the almost  compliant docs to Accting/Finance for fine tuning.    A key action item is getting a presentation set up where there is a good  download of information from Acct/Finance to the Development group.  We had  one yesterday for Legal, and it was helpful.  I want to sit in when your  troops get the presentation, if at all possible, because I can help translate  on both sides, I believe.  I also want to make sure that Development and  Legal are on the same page.  Fire drill avoidance is a key objective.  Look forward to discussing in detail.  Kay",mann-k
7837,"Hi.  Happy Mother's Day.  I was kinda hoping for a post-graduation family  event on that Saturday, as  hopes were raised when the ticket issue came up.  Doesn't sound like that's  happening.   I don't know when we will be up that way, but it wouldn't  surprise me if we headed up Sat am.  That's Memorial Day weekend, so traffic  out of Houston on Friday will be horrific.  Neil and I haven't discussed any  details yet, though.  Paige is supposed to intern with the Houston Aeros this summer.  No pay,  which is a bad thing.  She is currently on the way to Colorado with some  friends, and will be back a week from Sunday.  I haven't even mentioned Mac's  graduation yet.    I just finished a really busy time, and I'm optimistic that things will  resume a more normal pace.  I hope to catch up on yard work this weekend,  maybe clean out a closet.  I have the urge to purge.    I would say the Katie got the Clarke math gene, but Paige is a math whiz.  It  must be a recessive characteristic.  It is great that the girls have  different arenas in which to excel.    I sent Mom a table top cactus garden.  Hope it gets there.    No clue on what to get Mac.

7875,"Nothing fatal. Here are some thoughts/comments on the AMA for your general  consideration:  2.2 (d) Bank accounts/bookkeeping.  I've previously been advised that Corp  performs this function.    Issues which arise: will the money be invested  overnight, who has signature authority, etc.  We have a draft services  agreement prepared for Peoples which can serve as a ""go by"" if you decide you  need a separate doc.  2.2 (b)Billing/collection.  Responsibility generally should stop at sending  nastygrams.  No duty to hire lawyers, etc.  2.2 (f) Insurance.  In Texas, you have to have licenses to buy/sell insurance  and adjust claims.  Current language may be soft enough to not violate  licensing laws.  2.2 (g) cost of filing for licenses and permits not included in defn of  Marketing Expenses, but there's some catch all language that might help.  2.3  Accountants may like it to be clear that we can't hire/fire O & M  contractor, set O & M policies, or dispatch plant.  3.2   If there are multiple transactions in a short period, these may be  captured in one document, not one document for each transaction.   It would be helpful if the EEIM for use with others explains our agency  role. (may be in there - didn't review a copy) Is the Owner a power marketer  yet?  Are we helping them get EEIM's with the Approved Counterparties, or are  they on their own?   Will Enron sign on behalf of Owner for Contractor (Enron) transactions  (sounds silly)?  Is there an EEIM in the works between EPMI and Owner?    3.3 (f) I suspect by now you've figured out profits, etc, relating to ""day  of"" transactions.    3.4  last line - should it be interruptible instead of contingent?  Assume  Owner has transmission risk?  Is there a ""no third party beneficiary"" clause?  I might have missed it.  Not  life or death.  Interesting structure.  Could I get a copy of the final document?  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

8041,"Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant  Tom Knudson   May. 16, 2001  Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN  Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World  Reporter (TM)   Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss  Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four  environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four  signed an agreement not to ""participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory  challenge"" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial  concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental ""monitoring and research.""   Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been  difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and  permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that  money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor  of economic development.  Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their  concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it,  especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and  Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.  So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement  with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on  the marine environment.  Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.  Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in  mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:  $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of  seawater.  $425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor  heated seawater discharge in the ocean.  $1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to  monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the  Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter  Project.  $100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for  injured animals onto power plant property.  $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for  infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.  $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in  Moss Landing.  $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle  Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to  maintain the trail.  ""It is very disheartening,"" said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along  with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider  an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.  ""These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the  attorneys,"" said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources  Control Board. ""We could have been much more successful with their help. But  there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them.""  Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director  for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that  was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal  possible in the current energy climate.  ""Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right  now,"" said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources  on line.  The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in  2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy  expansion plan.  No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine  Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the  Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000  each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that  helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.  Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said  the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a  biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey  Bay.  ""Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation,"" he said. ""Not a  penny comes to me.""  Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been  stirred by a handful of people.  ""It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies,"" said Duke spokesman  Tom Williams. ""Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was  designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort  level.""  The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than  $12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in  connection with the plant modernization.  The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a  nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to  ""mitigate"" environmental impacts of the plant.  Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote ""the wise use and  conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands,"" its Web site says.  However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is  inadequate.  ""If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would  say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board  for the price of mitigation,"" Chabot said. ""The agencies got bought off  cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners.""  Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation ""must be based  on science, not on buying anybody off,"" he said. ""That is inappropriate, and  we would not participate in that.  ""That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any  environmentalist.""  Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection  office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. ""We are confident it  will improve the slough ecosystem,"" he said.  Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a  citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the  recipients of Duke's payments a ""shopping list"" of government agencies,  environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical  of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.  ""You know what bothers me?"" Clark said. ""Environmental groups get tons of  donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big  corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem  with that.""  Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of  natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased  from PG&E in 1998.  If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for  more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.  ""This is a big deal,"" said Williams, the Duke spokesman. ""It will be the  largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose  the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of  California.""  Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system,  which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss  Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They  argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate  water.  ""Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the  harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with  much of the marine life cooked and dead,"" said Steve Shimek, executive  director of the Otter Project.  For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by  Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the  plant's impact on the environment.  ""There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing  harm to the environment,"" said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our  Shores. ""We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue.""  Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial  payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.  The process ""gave me tremendous pause and great concern,"" Nichols said. ""I  knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong  thing.""  She was right.  ""As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy  wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods,"" said Clark, of the  citizens group.  Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy  approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions  if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.  Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison  between the two offers, calling it ""grossly unfair and inaccurate.""  Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain  the process. ""It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical,"" she  said.  Shimek took a different view. ""We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward  monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to  haunt them,"" he said.  ""Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we  did.""  ",mann-k

It would be easier to process this agreement if the  effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building  permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the  time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.  Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for  the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.

8161,"Gentlemen,  I thought I would pull together a brief email outlining where we are on  certain tasks.  Here goes:  Hub Agency Agreement - Gregg recently met with Peoples to discuss some of the  outstanding commercial issues relating to the Hub Agency Agreement.  Roy is  putting together a summary of the outcome of that meeting.  Gregg and I  decided it would be better to not send Peoples the current draft of the  agreement which has been circulated internally, but instead will send a draft  which incorporates the outcome of these discussions.  Memo regarding restricted activities - David has prepared a draft for Enron's  review.  Here's the draft:  Gregg and I need to review it.  Gregg and Peoples have been working on the grandfathered transaction list.   Since both sides are running behind on this,  David prepared a very straight  forward amenment to the LLC agreement, exending the time frame for finishing  the task.  Here it is:    Policies - Gregg   Penman has been working on a credit policy,  cash management policy, risk management policy, and probably a couple of  others I'm forgetting.  Revolving line of credit - Gregg has been working the internal Enron system  to get approval for a $50mm line of credit for MEH.  He has raised the issue  of Peoples needing to provide a guarantee for their half.  Also, it may be  necessary or advisable to document that the line of credit will be paid  before any distributions are made to either member.  This is still under  internal review at Enron.  I will check around to see if Corp (the lender)  has a form of credit facility we should use.  Miscellaneous: Decide about services agreement Confidentiality agreements  Transfer pricing documentation Other agreements (ISDA, GISB, Peaking Agency, Third Party Master) Board resolution appointing officers/managers Budget and marketing plan  Other administrative functions (per Gregg's Business Setup Items list)  Hope this is helpful.

Enron can't stay on the hook for payment if the agreement is assigned, as  this would bust the financing/accounting arrangement.  What we have tried to  do to meet your concerns is to see that ABB has a contract with a party which  is as financially sound as Enron by adding the guaranty language.  This  addresses ABB's request that the party with the payment obligation have the  ""financial wherewithall"" to make the payments. This is a big change from  where we were in the last contract.

A 10% limit of liability during the warranty period  is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit  of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense. Another  factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the GE  contract.

It is so funny, because the button gets pushed  accidently when it is being hauled around, so it is constantly growling.  We saw a few drops of rain, but nothing to help the water bill.  The smog is  horrible.  I'm in town all week this week, which is nice.  Neil and I have a birthday  party to go to for our neighbor Donnie (he was at the party) on Friday, so  Michael will spend some time with Charlotte again. She should be off of most  of her restrictions tomorrow, so maybe he will get to see her more.    We went to the Astros game last night, and they actually won.  Sammy Sosa hit  a home run harder than any I've seen before.  Even some of the Astros fans  clapped at the sheer force of it.

Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go  through six month rotations in various parts of the business. In addition,  there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.  If you see something  that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get  the inside scoop.    FYI, Enron North America, Enron Broadband, and Enron Energy Services are good  choices.  ENA is the old Enron Capital & Trade, so it is the real heart of  Enron (yes, it is where I now work).

We have presented to People's  a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel.   Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and  the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization.  The  essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to  $25mm, as our fee.  In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial,  legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together  on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.  We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week.  The basic goals are:  Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron  Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and  covered by our confidentiality agreement. Define term (5 years)   Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split  50/50, with prior approval.  In that regard an immediate concern is getting  the engineering work kicked off.    We want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.  We do not  want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our  methodology.  Please correct/supplement, etc.    Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

8550,"Enron Pres: Still Committed to Power Generation Business Wednesday, September 6, 2000 12:49 PM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	By James Covert  	Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Despite an increasing emphasis on wholesale trading  rather than asset ownership in its electricity operations, Enron Corp. (ENE,  news, msgs) will continue to develop and purchase power plants, president  Jeffrey Skilling told Dow Jones Newswires on Wednesday.  	""Generation assets are essential to a successful trading operation,"" Skilling  said, responding to recent trade reports that the company plans to exit the  power generation business. The Houston-based energy company is ""absolutely  not"" selling its power plants as part of its strategy, he said.  	Enron will continue to build and purchase natural gas-fired ""peaking plants,""  which produce power only during times of high demand and wholesale prices,  Skilling said.  	Enron has begun construction of a few such projects in the U.S. Midwest and  South, and will continue development chiefly in the U.S and Europe, he said.  	""The margins are higher (in wholesale power markets) in Europe,"" Skilling  said. ""The market there is more fractional, and that creates more  opportunities for someone who's playing across the board.""  	Developments in Europe, particularly in southern Europe, also offer a higher  per-unit rate of return, Skilling said.  	Nonetheless, Skilling did confirm that the company isn't interested in  building larger-sized plants in any country, and that its construction goals  may not be as lofty as those of other energy companies.  	""We are not interested in building base-load plants,"" Skilling said,  referring to large power plants that produce power in steady quantities  around the clock.  	""Base load simply delivers megawatts - that's a bulky, undifferentiated  commodity,"" Skilling said. ""But peaking plants allow us to play on the shape  of the market of that commodity.""  	Skilling declined to give any projections or figures related to Enron's  future development plans, saying that they weren't set in stone.  	But Skilling said the company generally aims to site power plants where there  are bottlenecks in the transmission system, and that Enron isn't focused on  any one geographic region as opposed to others.  	""There are companies out there saying they're going to build 40,000  megwawatts by such-and-such a date, and I don't really see how that's  possible,"" Skilling said. ""There are just too many variables to approach  markets like that.""  	-By James Covert, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;  james. ",mann-k

If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle  back with Lisa.  A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both  ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for  payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't  been addressed with GE.

8586,"Calif Pwr Woes Tuesday, September 12, 2000 08:15 AM	  	 	 	?Mail this article to a friend  	 	(This article was originally published Monday)  	WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited  authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged  price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's  wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a  congressional panel Monday.  	The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff  investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes  available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing  of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.  	""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction,  we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as  some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking  market-based rates or otherwise.""  	However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under  the Federal Power Act.  	""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis.  Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as  authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,""  Hoecker testified.  	The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we  have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of  the pending staff investigation.  	Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San  Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its  retail customer base.  	Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power  Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this  summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much  for power as they did a year ago.  	State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis  	The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra  Energy (SRE, news, msgs), sought an order setting price caps for power bid  into the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an  order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's  independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price  controls don't apply.  	FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's  bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it  left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the  price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the  power exchange.  	Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to  place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated  market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market  volatility.  	And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer  transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations,  or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the  power-supply problem.  	FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in  California because its experience with new market institutions such as power  exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.  	Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California  in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,""  Hoecker noted.  	Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is  in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale  markets,"" he said.  	""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the  lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.  	Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated market  structure.  	By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all their  electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price  risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left  consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said  officials with Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) and Reliant Energy (REI, news,  msgs).  	California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default  utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to  their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.

If we want  to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs  to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter  what.  In other words, if we want to add the language Rusty suggested, it  should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement.   We'll need to run this back through Accounting.  I really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. If we add  the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back  through Accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language.

8704,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:  1. Advantages to the single contract:  Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one. Better from a liability standpoint. Easier to administer.  Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?  2. Repayment/prepayment  I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.  3.  Assignment to Mitsui  Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested  payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the  assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE  contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.   Peggy is checking on this, also.  4. Parent guaranty.  GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft  contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the  current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment  to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider  inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after  execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if  necessary.

8706,"	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--In the latest update of Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, msgs)  bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said Tuesday that it has  completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth.  	Speaking at the Dain Rauscher Energy 2000 Conference, Enron Chairman Ken Lay  talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for  bandwidth trading and broadband services.  	Asked what kind of company Enron is, Lay gave an answer that shows the recent  expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy. Enron is still  basically ""an energy and broadband company,"" he said.  	While energy is still the source of most of Enron's revenue, Lay's answer  underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth  trading. A number of Enron officials have been quoted in the last year as  saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those  areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses.  	Enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same  amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading,  Lay said. It will spend more during that time if necessary.  	In fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in  emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet Enron's  standards. Proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and  bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said.  	In pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, Enron's 90 bandwidth deals  put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area. El Paso Energy  Corp. (EPG, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth  trades this year. Companies like Williams Communications Group (WCG, news,  msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made.  	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a  telecommunications network.  	Enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the  end of this year, Lay said. Some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or  made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later.  	The company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in New York,  Los Angeles, Las Vegas and London. Enron's current plans call for a total of  13 pooling points.  	Bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can  connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another,  facilitating bandwidth trading.  	Enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in  December as part of its deal with Blockbuster Video and a number of telecom  carriers.  	The deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract  value of more than $1 billion to Enron, according to materials the company  handed out at the conference.

I guess I'm a little  upset because you comment on how I do things (I don't even try to fold  clothes, pack the car, unpack the groceries, load the dishwasher, etc.) but  if I say something about how you do something, you get upset and say you  can't do anything right (so I should feel guilty about saying anything about  anything).  Gotta go.  We can talk about it later if you want.  Love,  Kay   ",mann-k
8881,"Here's the latest revision inserting the drawing numbers.  Is it ready to go  to GE?    Scott, payment for change orders is addressed in the contract.  ",mann-k

8885,Just a small piece of internal discussions regarding the revolving line of  credit and how it ties in with the enovate bank account. ,mann-k
8886,"Roxanne,  Thank you for calling last night. We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate  his first day at SF, and missed your call. Michael had a great first day.   All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.  I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.  We live on  Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.  It is  nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.  Again, thanks for calling.  Kay",mann-k
8887,"Tough time of day to dress for, but I think  you have it figured out.     ",mann-k
8888,I don't have a lot of formal stuff that fits me now - I've gained weight in  the past 18 months.  I may do a little shopping.    ,mann-k
8889,"Hi Scott,  Here's a revised draft for your review and comment.  I've taken out the  balance of plant warranty because you raised a valid point about them knowing  what BOP entails.  So now it is just a warranty. I've also been more explicit  about our fee.  I think there's a bit of confusion embedded in the document because of the  uncertainty about who is doing what, but I haven't come up with a simple fix  yet.   ",mann-k
8890,"Sorry, didn't mean to forget you. ",mann-k
8891,That's a good one.,mann-k
8892,"I knew you guys would hit a home run!  I have a conference call at 330, then I'll come see you.  Kay",mann-k
8893,"Brian,  The termination agreement needs to be signed at the same time.  Here is what  I have as the latest draft:    I never received a copy of the assignment and assumption agreemen, and the  legal assistants have not been able to locate it.  Has anyone found it?  If  not, we need to get a copy from GE.  Kay ",mann-k
8894,"Please print for me.  Thanks,  Kay ",mann-k
8895,More to go with that other print job. ,mann-k
8896,"Warning: I have not even opened this to see how it looks.    The goal is to delete the reference to WestLB and the master agreement, so I  know there is work to be done along those lines.  At least this is a start.  Kay   ",mann-k
8897,"This is for the PSCO project, and Ben wants Chris to sign it.  I'm thinking  that this is Dale's project, so I'm sending him a copy.  If it looks ok to you I will clean it up and send it to GE for their review.  Kay ",mann-k
8898,Maybe I'll get your address right this time. ,mann-k
8899,"Jerry,  Thanks.  I'll give it a look immediately, and will discuss the game plan with  Heather.  Congratulations on wrapping up the alliance and associated agreements.  Looks  like an interesting and exciting opportunity for both companies.  Kay",mann-k

8905,"Here is the current rev of the EECC ""standard"" form which I am  reviewing/massaging in connection with the 97 10 exercise.  It includes the  exhibits, where I think you can find something useful.  If this doesn't help, please let me know and I will check elsewhere.  Thanks,  Kay ",mann-k
8906,"Mark,  I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special  Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land Development the Owner?  Will  it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the  relevant land options and the commencement of construction?  I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would  impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are  not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.

8913,"Gregg,  It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most  appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use. Peoples has  forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.  Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting  point for discussions.  Since these are forms, there will certainly be  aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and  Enron.  These documents should be treated as confidential.",mann-k
8914,"Hi Ben,  Janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for  development documents.  How do you want you name to read on the corporate  documents?  Thanks,  Kay",mann-k

8917,I've already discussed this with Mark H. and he thought it had already been  done. I haven't found any indication that it has been done.  I'll follow up  immediately.  Kay,mann-k
8918,"Deb,  I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea. I'll have to  check on the expense account stuff.  Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could  you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address  those, as well as ENA?  Thanks,  Kay ",mann-k
8919,"Lisa,  I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an  offsite, so I might have missed something.  I'll get you a copy of CO #1.  CO  #2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.  I'll have to confirm the status  of the MOU and CO#3/#4.  These have bounced around a bit, so I need to nail  it down so I don't give you bad information.  Kay",mann-k

Michael has  an appointment at 230, so I will be out of a while.    This is great stay home weather.  I have fires in the fireplaces.  All I'm  missing is the smell of bread baking!  Kay",mann-k
8923,"I thought the conference was pretty good.  I had a great room, with a HUGE  jacuzzi tub.  Did anyone get promoted?  No one said anything about  promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.    I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got  out some clothes to give to the maid.  It all feels good.  I'm going to do email now.  See you tomorrow!  Kay",mann-k
