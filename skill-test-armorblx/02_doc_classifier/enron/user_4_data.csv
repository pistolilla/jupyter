Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal  (2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.  (3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)  (4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's  (5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.  (6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral  (7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB  (8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC  Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.

468,"Jay and Tanya:  Legal would like to speak with one of you about the ""Chase"" and ""Morgan"" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.  (1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA (""the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]  (2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.  (3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.  (4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.  (5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.  On a different note,  (5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed ""mini-netting"" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar ""mini-netting"" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.  (6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.  (7)  The names   raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

480,"ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.  ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year.   I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.  Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.  NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.  I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my   section.  Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.

As  always, I am impressed with the variety and number of individuals with whom  you are so well connected.  At the moment, we are trying to finalize an  internal memorandum addressing the breadth of the tax issues currently  affecting our business in Argentina.  I would appreciate your comment on the  following two items:  (1)  Can you cite the law that provides the exemption or modification (not  sure which it is) that ""financial institutions"" are taxed (Gross Receipts) on  the spread?  Is it possible to see a copy? (I can probably have it translated)  (2)  I am unclear as to how the Stamp Tax would be calculated with respect to  Argentine local parties to an ISDA Master Agreement (crossborder trades) or a  local master swap agreement (local trades).  Execution of the master  agreement itself does not evidence any transaction.  Even when any  transaction is executed, you are unable to determine net payments owed by  either party until termination of the deal.  Brent thinks that the tax will  be based on the product of the [Fixed Price  X volume X term] even though the  master agreement will merely provide for netting.  Can you verify?

I am currently into Danish  modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I  know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was  outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems  (which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with  Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw   which  is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother  how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she  could check her stock portfolio periodically.

With respect to the CSA  and calculation of the   the amount calculated (deemed  to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent  Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a  difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when  the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that  only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will  be returned).

928,"Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as  good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The  Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for  the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover  since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister  ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other  Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in  Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is  only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents  are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.   He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the  trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most ""help"" since that sweet little  bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise,  I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her  number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with  Ron?  Love, Sara",shackleton-s

I told Harry that I would need to review the  agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order  to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry  does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he  is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future.   We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.  Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement ""as is"" for the  limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of  terminating the agreement when he is done.

I just wanted  to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during  the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA  Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble  language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase  ""Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff  ...;provided, however,"" actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT  to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early  Termination Date.

977,"Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to  execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already  have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely  upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services  agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade  is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the  trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron  affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron  affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts  with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The  credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal  back to back transaction with the ""booking"" Enron affiliate)  for which the  ""booking"" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services  agreement.  Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of  Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth  Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove  described arrangement?",shackleton-s

990,This applies to all counterparties! ,shackleton-s
991,"Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with  their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to  permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable  by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the  Payee).  So here's my recommendation:  (1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of  suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be  based upon satisfaction that ""nondisputed"" amounts having been paid by the  DP.  Will he also raise the ""other agreements"" issue here?  Not a clue.  (2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M  FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)  (3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently,  right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A  as applying to ""other agreements between the parties"".  But Cargill proposed  part A and it DOES apply to ""other agreememts between the parties.""  I don't  want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this  again with Marty.

1122,"Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA  Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of  the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was  attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.  (1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant? (2)  The Schedule is missing some ""standard"" Enron type provisions (which  were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include:  limitation of liability  confidentiality  setoff    isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach. (3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which  is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court  in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration.   With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver  of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the  Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections  to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere. (4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust  intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other  transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.   What eventually happens to the Trust?  Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS. Call if you need anything else.  Sara",shackleton-s

On  April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title  to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of  ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently  trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent  to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.

Is trading in  credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of  derivatives?

Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from  regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying  commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering  into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA  MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot  solicit the party to enter into the transaction.  If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our  confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or  sell by the counterparty.

Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to  Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun,  even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty  capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each  confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on  behalf of Enron Corp.).

NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal  perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's ""regulated""  product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX  and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity)  choose to become a regulated ""ATOM"" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal  perspective, I think we should have a ""whitepaper"" drafted by Sullivan &  Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing  situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought  about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations,  whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and  perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas,  etc.) and any other related issues?

The Master is not restricted to any particular type of  transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.  ENA is the  Calculation Agent.  Also, only commodity transactions are netted.  (2)  Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.  The  amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the  collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities.   It also states Citibank to be ""multibranch"" with NY and London offices acting  under the Master.  Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the  Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).  Mollie Harris in  credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.

Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).

PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN  (2)  With respect to the right of ""multiple optional partial swap  terminations"", please verify that:  (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially  terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times,  without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or  any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells  the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple  requests) to be documented?

Also, for netting reasons, Japan  would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent  Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend  the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal  if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to  ENA's agreement).

These two documents are intended to supplement the  boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.

Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities  appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the  financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not  limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and  transactions thereunder.

2053,"Andy:  In the spirit of ""full disclosure"", I thought I would let you know what ENA  has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities. ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch  Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95). There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely  silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).   All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language  (in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in  general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All  of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting  parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.  I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:  change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time) delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required  language delete the arbitration provision in its entirety  I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that  we can finalize docs by the afternoon.

It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not  necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by  legal and credit.  (2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS  NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to  simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA  terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for  upgrading to an ISDA.

Negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name, phone number and  email address for the counterparty's LAWYER (I know you tried!).  If the  counterparty is truly anxious to trade, the commercial guys will pressure the  legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball  rolling.  Otherwise, things will sit around and go nowhere.  Just remember that an ISDA negotiation is USUALLY longer with a governmental  entity because ENA requires more information (legal opinion, copies of  statutes, authority in the form of a full Board resolution, etc.) and  government lawyers may be short staffed.  Sometimes the counterparty will  hire outside counsel which may go more quickly, but not always.  If a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading  documents, the negotiations may end within a week (but I have never seen this  happen with a governmental).

EWEB has not  yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed  legal opinion.  EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending  resolution of the master agreement.  Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by  the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given  point in time.  EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing  whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is  authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and  the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons  (employed by governmental entities) are completely void.    Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into  financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.  However,  you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.  Before you ever  trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past  relationship with an EWEB trader.  You will first have to conduct some due  diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.  ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.

The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or  occur on a French regulated market  2.  One of the parties must be (a) an ""investment firm"" within the meaning of  the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the  provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a  ""comparable status""  The term ""investment firm"" embodies financial type institutions which recieve  and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.  There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France,  insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation  includes ""persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to  their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do  not prohibt the carrying on of investment services"".  Slaughter and May has  advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French  counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with  the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other  categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.  The non-resident entity having ""comparable status"" is the category WE were  trying for fit into without much success.  Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.

2660,"Mark:  Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of  outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of  those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the  economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an  existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a  ""deemed"" version of such an agreement or (3) ""terms and conditions"" appearing  in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three  types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit  event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or  termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the  Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the  transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit  provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As  a result, a party attempting to ""step into the shoes of the Canadian company""  must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality  restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with  assuming those positions.

In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to  change!  The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements  requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.  If you don't have an  ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be  viewed by a court as a single agreement.  Having different versions of the  GTC's does not look like a single agreement.  I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move  forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.

I have questions about market disruption because Con Ed has asked:  (1)  that Market Quotation apply rather than Loss (in the event of Early  Termination)  Is this a very liquid market?  ENA agrees to market quotation only for FX  and short term deals in liquid markets (e.g., gas)  (2)  to jointly determine when a Market Disruption has occurred (after  consultation)  Usually ENA as the Calculation Agent makes this determination in good faith.  (3)  to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining  the daily MTM  Each party typically assesses its own MTM for valuation purposes (whether  for collateral calls or termination, etc.).  Sounds like Ed and I need to  know what was said to Con Ed about marking  (4)  I think Con Ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each  provide dealer quotes (rather than ENA coming up with two quotes in good  faith) as a Disruption Fallback.

3146,"Darren:  (1)  Goldman Sachs ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June  15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to  execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this  morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email  address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further  documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by  email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements  and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.  (2)  UBS Warburg I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already  trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly  enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by  a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with  UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy  to let you access their platform.

3150,"Clem:  Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp.  guaranty.  A few points:  (1)  Bear claims that the ""cap"" language which we typically include is  inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount  is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard  of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if  you'd like.  (2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with  respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added ""performance"" to the  guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the  payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have  to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.   Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is  essentially reduced to a payment of money).    (3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should  refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!  Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with  Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks.

It is in both parties best interest to have an executed  (and therefore enforceable) writing  This can be accomplished by under the NY  General Obligations law by our agreement as to a ""deemed response"" if a party  will not sign a trade confirmation.  (2)  regarding the concept of  , ENA has reconsidered  the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified  Conditions.  It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the  occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to  rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions.

I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression  that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss  Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a  status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is ""project""  oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.  FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage  agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was  apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to ""cleanup"" the  agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as  have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really  want her to be trained in the swap basics.

(3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to  absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all  agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority  to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC  issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a ""Regulatory  Development"" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we  may also have a Termination Event under our current format).",shackleton-s

4201,"The financial trading group has a recurring request by our conterparties to  add a provision addressing the admissability of trader tapes into evidence in  court or other proceedings.  Our current language merely states:  ""Each party  consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other  party of any and all communications between officers or empoyees of the  parties, and waives any further notice of such recording.""  Here are the  facts and issues:  1.  Our agreements provide for arbitration (most likely) or jurisdiction in  specific courts or are silent as to jurisdiction.  2.  ENA policy is to destroy trader tapes after 6 months.  3.  If we are doing our job, a written and signed confirmation should exist  in our files for each and every financial transaction.  On occasion, we have  not confirmation signed by ENA's counterparty.  By agreeing to add ""admissability"" language, are we waiving the parol  evidence rule?  Do we always want the ability to introduce existing  recordings?  Can you provide us with language acceptable to ENA that we might propose to a  counterparty (when asked)?  Here's an example of a recent request:  ""Any such recordings may be submitted  in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the prupose of  extablishing any matters pertinent to the [ISDA] Agreement.""

4267,"Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to  the distinction between ""investor owned utilities"" (or ""IOUs"") and municipal  utilities (or ""municipals"") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the  U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus,  we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an  Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance  in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that  Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with  respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA  Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S.  Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of    and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that  Schedule is also attached for your reference.  We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada,  and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when  a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government  may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you  recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities  and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?",shackleton-s

I can't recall if you were going to try to  speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the  ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically,  with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also  going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.   Please advise when you have further information.

4381,"Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit  should have a ""separate worksheet"" and make a determination for each question  you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One  issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given  structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no  financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a  different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less  determine if that counterparty is an ESP?  I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be  inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a  partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help  in the evaluation.  Are we going to have another credit lunch?

Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and  the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.
