Peter is looking currently for a job.  I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with  Mathematics society at the University of Houston.  The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further  efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor  fuel.  Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.   Vince Kaminski    ",kaminski-v

18,"Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the  code.  Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points.   1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.  It's not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the ""research projects"" and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just  Tanya's issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on  Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince",kaminski-v

We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like  to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of  our insights to the consultant. In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the  details and in the inputs and calibration. The same model may produce drastically different results  depending on the quality of inputs.   2. We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group. We  were told that you would provide an IT resource. Alex would supervise this person.   Vince",kaminski-v

I am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation of ability to think independently and having the courage of one' s convictions.  Nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything. The only way we can learn and avoid costly errors (to ourselves and the company) is by having open communication.  In Enron, facts are friendly.  By the way, it was an excellent presentation.

What follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on  the power situation in India published by The Financial Times.   The first article describes recent power outage in northern India affecting  millions of people. One possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of  output lost due  to  power shortages. It is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost  of power produced by the Dhabol plant (expensive as it may be). The power cut affected 230  million people.  The second article is Enron specific.  Vince",kaminski-v

The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.  For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag  lunches are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.  Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.  Vince  ",kaminski-v

The longer I think about it, the more  convinced I become that some action  is required.  Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a  female employee was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months  later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar  cases, courts  subsequently  found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such  complaints.  The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is  immaterial.  If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double  standard in handling sexual harassment cases.  My recommendation would be to ask Maureen to attend sensitivity training and  sexual harassment prevention class.  Please, let me know what you think. Sorry to burden you with this case.

I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other  side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. ""The  Return of Grant  Masson"" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth  opportunities (and that I am good manager).  Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just  re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required  to hire a VP.  Vince",kaminski-v

949,"Mark,  Two points.   1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of ""Power  Play"", is on a tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40  people attended.  2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an  article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself.  I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.  b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up  with a term ""proactive evolution"", as opposed to ""reactive evolution.""  c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.  d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts.  The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.    Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players.  Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.  Vince   ",kaminski-v

Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.  Vince",kaminski-v

A few comments.  1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston  (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs. The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to  multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).  2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated  positions and prices on a regular basis.  3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:   a.

We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested. We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall. The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general  concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business. The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired  power plants).  The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this  is a perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed earlier.  Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely,  optimistic, pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.  The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk. This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised in the future through active management of a project.  The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real  challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30  years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The  challenge is not to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand  specific  businesses into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to  stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions. If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions. I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices, but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic  upward trend. One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.",kaminski-v

1559,"Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince",kaminski-v

1648,"John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree. It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not  have good answers.",kaminski-v

1658,"David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the  problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will  investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity  should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense  to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less  transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be  systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the  responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince",kaminski-v

1693,An interesting piece of information from the oil markets.  Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and  transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by  Saddam's government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.  Vince,kaminski-v

1891,"Jeff,  I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 -  30 minutes to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze. A separate message about  this visit will follow.  I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships  with different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.  We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we  are not very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:  1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently   underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results. Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock-up some very promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs.  2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every  presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions. It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic  program. In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years.  3. Visits by faculty members in Enron.   Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important  in shaping public  opinion on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets).  Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and  focus.  I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level)  responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from  our Analyst/Associate program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.  Vince",kaminski-v

1976,"Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power  The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.  The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry.  Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material.  In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments.  Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.  The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges.  In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library. ",kaminski-v

1992,"John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince",kaminski-v

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).    On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client  for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor  or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal  customer will be quite a challenge.

I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my  presentation (or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and  Power 1999): the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.   My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the  presentation and I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the  credit when the credit is due.

3350,"Steve,  Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal rules going forward.  My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full  picture. Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no control long-term.  I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules for the Research sign-off.

Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on  Tanya's report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very  mechanical implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to  optimize it.  Let's keep paddling along.  Vince   ",kaminski-v

The system does not allow me to correct the  mistake by moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.  As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity  raises. The column totals are misleading.  I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20  Wharton School students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a  special project, proposed by a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the  impact of electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will   result in a report that will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will  find this report useful.   We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on  Thursday,  January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron.

3466,"Erin,  A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important references to more advanced books and papers. The book has an endorsement  by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.  The Research Group offered  several one-day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry. We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested. We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall. The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general  concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business. The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired  power plants).  The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this  is a perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed earlier.  Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely,  optimistic, pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.  The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk. This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised in the future through active management of a project.  The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real  challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30  years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The  challenge is not to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand  specific  businesses into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to  stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions. If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions. I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices, but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic  upward trend. One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.",kaminski-v

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).    On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client  for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer will be quite a challenge.

3791,"Wade,  I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.  A brief outline of the facts.  1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy is also very complicated.  2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a  tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.  The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an  outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American  society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his  behalf to the State Department.  I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.  I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds.  I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.  Thanks.  Vince  ",kaminski-v

I treat the Monday  meeting as the opportunity to introduce Enron to Prediction Company and to inform you about Enron's trading operation and especially about our electronic trading platforms.

My group has currently a research project under way to explore the possibility of taking advantage of some recent developments in the market microstructure theory in our operations.  I think that we can definitely collaborate in the energy and other commodity markets and we can explore other possibilities as well.

4137,"Joannie:  Thanks Here is the message for Jeff:    Jeff,  I am asking you on my behalf and on behalf of Rick Causey to make a keynote presentation at the annual Energy Finance Conference at the University of Texas at Austin. The conference is tentatively scheduled to take place on February 21 - 22, 2002. Depending on your calendar, the conference organizers can reserve a time slot for your presentation at the conference dinner (February 21, 2002, Thursday) or lunch (February 22, 2002, Friday).  This annual conference is devoted to financial engineering in the energy business. The topics covered in the past meetings  included applications of real options technology to the energy business, risk management and the future of deregulation. The agenda of the last conference is attached for your review; the agenda for the 2002 event is under development.   Given Enron's relationship with UT and our interest in the Energy Finance program,  a great source of highly skilled talent for our Analyst / Associate Program, we think that your participation will benefit the company. The conference is widely attended by senior executives of other energy companies and is an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and the  agenda for the future.

Mark Ruane whom you met, moved on to a new job and his successor is a bit skeptical about the need for a study. Internal Enron  perception is that we understand the process of decision making inside big  financial institutions (or lack of it), especially in the energy area, regarding valuation of investment projects. Any study would just reveal what we already understand about quite simplistic tools they use: DCF with a discount rate being subject to negotiations within a very broad band of potential values.  It will help if I get the agenda of the conference  soon to pass it on to Jeff Skilling. It would also help if you could write a formal letter to him.   Vince    ",kaminski-v

About 95% of installed capacity in Brazil is hydro (out of about 65 GW) and the level of water in the reservoirs  is about 20% of the normal. We have a huge exposure in Brazil given our LDC investments and merchant power plants.  Measuring water level in the reservoirs is a critical project and boys from Brazil  are asking for help. We have looked into a similar problem in Norway and came up with interesting technical solutions but had to drop it because of lawyers' objections. These objections may not apply to Brazil.  Can we arrange for a conference call between you and me and Remy Collonge from Sao Paulo to discuss the problem? He will be  back in his office on Tuesday .  I shall call you tomorrow about it.

4670,"David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince",kaminski-v

5170,"A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would like to share with you a few observations.  1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to Enron (and the P/E ratio).  A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and our strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management technology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.  It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about the quality of our financial technology. This can be done  through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past. by reality.  2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.  The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to the market observations (as opposed to historical data).  One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.  One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the trading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices  curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized  forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will  systematically fail.   One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the  source of problems we see in some books.  3. VaR process management.  Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory, a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios. What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality of the results.  Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility for the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used  currently in the system are 2 years old.  Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view  some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal usefulness (and in some case on questionable understanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties  and ",kaminski-v

5198,"Steve,  Thanks a lot. I think that having the pseudo code will go a long way towards  understanding how the system works and making sure that there are no bugs in translation of a business problem (for example, complicated credit insurance deals with multiple triggers and conditionality) into the  code.  Regarding Tanya's attitude. Just a few points.   1. I don't think she has the skills to do the system administrator's work and she does not have the necessary privileges. This explains why she keeps asking Winston for help.  It's not that the work is beneath her.  2. Some members of Tanya's team came to me complaining about Winston. He effectively told them to go away and work on the ""research projects"" and that he would take care of the IT issues. I don't think that it's just  Tanya's issue, though I agree that a more outgoing personality would be helpful.  3. The reality of this situation is that the internal customers beat  on  Tanya and me whenever there is any performance problems and/or they intuitively disagree with the results of a run. They could not care less about the demarcation line between IT and Research. They also want Tanya to sign off on the model and she cannot do it without full access to the code.  The bottom line is that we are in full agreement: Tanya and Winston have to work as a team and I shall work on my end to make sure that  it happens. Credit is emerging as a critical issue for Enron for the next few weeks and the system cannot fail.  Vince",kaminski-v

The longer I think about it, the more  convinced I become that some action  is required.  Let's try to reverse the situation and assume for the sake of argument that a  female employee was harassed by a male colleague. An employee informs her boss a few months  later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar  cases, courts  subsequently  found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such  complaints.  The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is  immaterial.  If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double  standard in handling sexual harassment cases.

I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He  wants to come back  after 2 months.  My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite  competent. I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other  side of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. ""The  Return of Grant  Masson"" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth  opportunities (and that I am good manager).  Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just  re-instate him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required  to hire a VP.  Vince",kaminski-v

6129,"Mark,  Two points.   1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of ""Power  Play"", is on a tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40  people attended.  2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an  article on EBS. I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself.  I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident. It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.  b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up  with a term ""proactive evolution"", as opposed to ""reactive evolution.""  c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.  d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts.  The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.    Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players.  Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.  Vince   ",kaminski-v

Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of  talent we have currently in London. Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.   My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,  highly respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy  level and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.  His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value  technical skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the  same caliber as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to  Houston for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a  sufficient incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has  greatly improved.  Please, let me know what you think.  Vince",kaminski-v

We want to  validate some  inputs before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both  London and Houston work with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.  A few comments.  1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston  (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs. The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to  multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee, please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).  2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated  positions and prices on a regular basis.  3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:   a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its  portfolios. This is the liquidity risk",kaminski-v

6714,"Erin,  A book by Martha Amram and Nalin Kulatilaka is an excellent non-technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important references to more advanced books and papers. The book has an endorsement  by Jeff Skilling on the cover page.  The Research Group offered  several one-day seminars on real options and applications to the energy industry. We still have a few binders with the presentation materials available if you are interested. We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall. The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general  concept of real options and their applicability to the energy business. The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes used to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case studies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired  power plants).  The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making investment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this  is a perfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed earlier.  Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through analysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely,  optimistic, pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk drivers and don't specify the future proactive management decisions.  The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) capture uncertainty in an explicit way and  (2) to design investment projects that allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk. This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future operational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised in the future through active management of a project.  The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come up with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real  challenge is to use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30  years of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The  challenge is not to run mechanically  thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions but to translate in a  creative   way the insights of people who understand  specific  businesses into parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to  stress-test the assumptions of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions. If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions. I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices, but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic  upward trend. One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what Economics 101 teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand.",kaminski-v

6739,"Chonawee,  As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad  decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).  Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option. You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to  $100.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise  gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes.   Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option  position as an offset.  The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have  income in the future (or capital gains).  Not so good.  By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options is a very interesting and difficult problem.  Vince",kaminski-v

6828,"John,  I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and  elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being  aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.  Now a few more detailed comments.  1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined  with  a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without  sufficient depth. One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The  approach used in valuation of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of  investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized  through other aspects of valuation technology used in RAROC.   If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent  and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that  I recommend this course of action).  2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.  Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.  He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the  floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as  opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes  fuzzy. The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on  two factors:  1. risk preference 2. existing portfolio positions  Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that  consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2  standard deviations. The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability  to absorb the loss. I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We  looked into insurance pricing at the request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more  about it.  Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease  the risk of the overall portfolio. I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not  look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region).  What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the  utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.   If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value). If we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk  premium.  In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot  hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of  the option. How big is the discount? See the comments above.   In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton  paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form  the point of view of  a seller and a buyer will converge.  3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?  We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will  recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world). If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of  NPV as of today. Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases  we are still holding it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is  equivalent to using a  discount rate with a risk premium.  I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a  delay in responding to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we  all agree.

6839,"David,  During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues  related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.  Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery  is poor  and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the  problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.  We have agreed on the following:  1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can  increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will  investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.  2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity  should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense  to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less  transparent aggregates.  3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be  systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the  trading positions. This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the  responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.  Vince",kaminski-v

6873,An interesting piece of information from the oil markets.  Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).  The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst). He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations. He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and  transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by  Saddam's government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.  Vince,kaminski-v

7071,"Jeff,  I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 -  30 minutes to discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze. A separate message about  this visit will follow.  I would like also to talk to you  about the way we manage our relationships  with different universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers of the academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.  We should rethink the way we work  with universities. The efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we  are not very successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:  1. Involvement in research projects. For  example, we are currently   underwriting two research projects at Stanford University, involving  Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos (a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulation of the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results. Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock-up some very promising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs.  2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every  presentation I have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions. It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic  program. In many cases, the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years.  3. Visits by faculty members in Enron.   Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students and obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important  in shaping public  opinion on the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets).  Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number of overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and  focus.  I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level)  responsible for coordinating our relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from  our Analyst/Associate program. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.  Vince",kaminski-v

7156,"Reviewed by Mark Williams, SVP Risk Management, Citizens Power  The long awaited second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk has finally arrived. It has been four years since the first edition was published. During this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline. The second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.  The books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity. As expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry.  Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors. Other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material.  In particular the chapter on energy options written by Michael Hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation. For the more advanced reader, the chapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by Vince Kaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments.  Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for Derivative Contracts in the Energy Environment by three consultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the US Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement 133 (see EPRM October 1999, page 22). Having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.  The second edition however is not without flaws. In particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques. Additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges.  In summary, this second edition of Managing Energy Price Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcome edition to any risk management library. ",kaminski-v

7172,"John,  This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.  1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH  and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the  decision to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island  project (please, see point 2).  2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest  (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island  transaction. The next step will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions   in one place and to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is  meeting to close a few remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.  A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:  a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island  facility by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.  The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long-term contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are  setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and  coordinating the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words, we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.  b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension  option of 5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for  such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread  and I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.  One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the  first 5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.  c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a  big prudence reserve in case we mark it to market.  d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island  deal (that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions. Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail  that  correlates very well with Brent.   Vince",kaminski-v

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager, effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus 10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager. Such promotions take place in March and I think Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management (i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).    On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client  for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor  or leave Enron. Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal  customer will be quite a challenge.
