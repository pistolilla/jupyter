0,"On Friday, the Assembly failed to get its version of the Edison MOU out of the appropriations committee. The bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full Assembly for passage. Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like. The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday. In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own ""date certain"" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access. The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25. We are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1) the date the bill is signed or 2) September 1. We will provide additional information on Tuesday about the bill's status and our progress in changing the suspension date.  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j

24," State's Electric Bill Gets Lighter   Energy: Davis and the PUC clash over why only a fraction of the 20% reduction will be passed on to consumers.  By MIGUEL BUSTILLO Times Staff Writer  October 20 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California now expects its electricity bill to be 20% less than estimated as recently as two months ago, opening the door for utility rate reductions or a smaller energy bond sale, the Davis administration said Friday.   Even so, the amount of savings passed on to consumers is likely to be closer to 5%, the administration added.   The discrepancy and its explanation are an extension of the ongoing political squabble between Gov. Gray Davis and Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch. Administration officials said residential customers won't see much relief because recent actions by the PUC have negated most of the gains from lower power prices and greater conservation.   Specifically, officials said, the PUC erred in giving business customers too much time to opt out of the state's power-buying system, and in holding up a bond sale to repay expensive energy loans.   Lynch disagrees on both points. The real problem, she said again Friday, is that California purchased too much power at too high a price during the energy crisis. The best way to save consumers money, she suggested, is to renegotiate the state's energy contracts.   California has been purchasing massive quantities of power since January because the state's large private utilities could no longer do so, and mass blackouts threatened to cripple the state's economy and endanger the public. The utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, ran up billions of dollars in debts because they were forced to buy power for far more than they could legally charge customers.   In August, state officials estimated the department's power costs for 2001 and 2002, the time the state plans to be in the power business, at $21.45 billion. The new estimate, released Friday, pares that figure to $17.2 billion.   But in what consumer groups angrily called a ""jailbreak,"" Davis administration officials disclosed for the first time Friday that large businesses fled the state's power-buying system en masse this summer, opting to cut their own deals with energy companies rather than shoulder their share of the state's power costs.   Big Businesses Bail Out, Leave Tab to Consumers  The PUC announced in June that it was putting a lid on the so-called direct-access deals because if the businesses left the system, homeowners and other small ratepayers would have to pay a larger share of the costs the state incurred buying power to avert blackouts in the energy crisis.   However, the commission did not act until last month, and in the meantime numerous businesses opted out of the state system. Direct-access participation jumped from 2% to 13% of the overall power load being purchased by the California Department of Water Resources, according to the administration's latest numbers.   ""Unfortunately, all of the savings generated by the improving market conditions will not be immediately passed on to ratepayers,"" said Pete Garris, who oversees the department's power-buying division. ""Put simply, the PUC's delay in suspending direct access means [the state's] costs will have to be recovered from fewer customers and the impact will be greatest on smaller, retail customers.""   State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who requested that the PUC suspend direct access earlier in the summer, blasted the commission Friday, saying the ""stampede"" of businesses would shift as much as $8 billion in costs to consumers over the next decade, as they pay for the long-term contracts the state signed this year to ensure a stable source of electricity.   ""What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that's happened to consumers in this energy crisis,"" Angelides said.   And consumer groups were even more critical, accusing the PUC of letting big business escape the costs of the energy crisis.     said Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary.",dasovich-j

98," Firms Push Edison Near Bankruptcy   Energy: Power generators ask firm to spell out how they will be repaid hundreds of millions of dollars for purchases under deregulation plan.  By NANCY VOGEL and JERRY HIRSCH TIMES STAFF WRITERS  September 29 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Five big energy companies owed hundreds of millions of dollars by Southern California Edison pushed the utility a step closer to bankruptcy Friday by asking Edison to sign an agreement spelling out how each will be repaid.  The companies demanded that Edison meet with them within two weeks to work out a repayment plan and implied that otherwise they would drag the Rosemead-based utility into Bankruptcy Court. Under federal law, any three creditors can force a company to file for bankruptcy if they are owed a combined $10,775. The five generating companies collectively are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, although the exact total is not known.  The letter was a significant step in maneuvering over Edison's fate--a dance that has gone on for months but now appears to be nearing its close. Edison has been reaching deals with some of its creditors, but has kept others waiting. Some power generators, in turn, have been threatening to push Edison into bankruptcy, although so far only Mirant Corp. and Reliant Energy have publicly embraced that idea. And Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leaders have continued to debate a plan that the governor believes could avoid a bankruptcy.  The letter, sent by William Bates III, a Palo Alto attorney representing the five power generators, expressed frustration that Edison so far has been unwilling to work out a repayment plan with large power producers. Under the Edison rescue plan that the Legislature debated and ultimately adjourned without passing earlier this month, Edison would have settled with its smaller creditors but been left with $1 billion in debt to big power sellers.  ""This group of creditors is significant in both number and amount and deserves and requires to be dealt with as such,"" says the letter to Edison's private attorney, Thomas B. Walper of Munger, Tolles & Olson in Los Angeles.  ""We would be willing to discuss any ideas SCE has"" about an agreement to repay its debt, the letter continues, ""but we don't want to waste anybody's time. Thus, as a first step we want to know whether SCE is interested in negotiating. . . . Please give us a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer to that question.  ""Of course, we reserve all our rights and remedies in the event that SCE does not want to meet on these terms or we cannot reach a mutually satisfactory agreement,"" Bates wrote.  The five companies are Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy Corp., Enron Corp. and Puget Sound Energy, which is the biggest investor-owned utility in Washington state.  Edison officials refused to comment.  The frustration on the part of the power generators appeared to mount Tuesday, when Edison announced that it had reached an agreement to pay off its $14-million debt to the city of Long Beach, which sold Edison electricity produced at a trash-fueled power plant on Terminal Island.  Edison has also reached repayment plans with many small and renewable power producers who collectively are owed $1.2 billion.  ""Edison can take steps to assure that all creditor classes are treated equally,"" said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston, which is owed $100 million to $200 million by Edison.  A spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant, which is also owed more than $100 million, sounded a similar note. ""It is time SCE made clear when, how much and even if it is going to pay us,"" Patrick Dorinson said.  So far, other creditors have balked at the idea of pushing Edison into bankruptcy, believing that a judge would probably consider a bankruptcy petition premature until after the Legislature meets Oct. 9 in a special session to deal exclusively with Edison's plight.  Davis, who insists that Edison should not be allowed to file for bankruptcy, ordered the new session earlier this month after legislators adjourned without passing any legislation that would shrink Edison's debt.  Other Creditors Take Notice  Senate leader John Burton, (D-San Francisco), has said that any such bill would have to guarantee that the burden of paying off the utility's $3.9-billion debt does not fall on homeowners and small-business owners.  The letter from the five generators caught the attention of other creditors who have so far played along with SCE's strategy of winning a legislative rescue.  ""From our perspective, the days of luxury for Edison are over,"" said John Moorlach, Orange County treasurer. The county holds $1 million of defaulted SCE bonds in its retirement plan.  Moorlach said he believes that if SCE does not quickly reach an agreement with the generators, they will push the utility into Bankruptcy Court.  ""By doing this, the generators are trying to show that they are making a good-faith effort to reach a settlement first,"" Moorlach said.  But Jay Lawrence, spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, said his members believe the move by the generators shows they have backed off from an immediate involuntary bankruptcy petition filing, at least while they try to open negotiations with SCE.  ""We still want to see a legislative solution, and we are against bankruptcy,"" Lawrence said.  Edison provides electricity to 11 million people. It racked up the $3.9-billion debt over the past year as it purchased high-priced electricity in the fledgling market California created under a 1996 deregulation plan. The state's deregulation plan included a rate freeze that barred Edison from passing the full cost of the power it bought on to customers.  By January, Edison's debt had grown so heavy that power sellers refused to deal with the utility. The state had to step in with taxpayer money to keep electricity flowing. So far, the state has spent $10.7 billion on power purchases.  Edison's counterpart in Northern California, Pacific Gas & Electric, suffered the same financial squeeze in the state's dysfunctional market. PG&E took itself into bankruptcy in April.  The generators' demand came on a day when Edison officials said they were close to winning an agreement from bankers to delay collecting on $200 million in loans until Oct. 19.  Shares of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, rose almost 5% Friday to close at $13.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.  *  Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this report.",dasovich-j

I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.

Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.

""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness. Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.  ""It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000 Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts, back on-line earlier this summer.  ""I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its creditors will continue to show restraint.""    ###    California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility  JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer Saturday, September 15, 2001  ?2001 Associated Press   URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2001/09/15/national0541EDT0485.DTL>  (09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --   The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.   As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.   But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.   ""We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor,"" said President Pro Tem John Burton. ""It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation.""   The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.   Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.   The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.   ""I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness,"" Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. ""Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.""   The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.   The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.   It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.   While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.   Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.   The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.   The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.   ""Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance,"" said Davis.   ?2001 Associated Press",dasovich-j

When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.

On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.   The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.

The Sacramento Bee <http://www.sacbee.com/about_us/legal>=20   Dan Walters: Edison bailout plan is oddest piece of legislation in recent m= emory    (Published Aug. 29, 2001)=20  Senate Bill 78XX may be the most unusual legislation to hit the Capitol in = decades, in terms of both its content and its convoluted political dynamics= .=20  The measure is the latest incarnation of months-long efforts by Gov. Gray D= avis and some legislators to rescue Southern California Edison from joining=  its larger cousin, Pacific Gas and Electric, in bankruptcy court. That is = odd unto itself, since state legislation to openly provide billions of doll= ars in benefits to one private corporation may be unprecedented.=20  Literally dozens of versions of legislation to bail out Edison have floated=  around the Capitol, ever since Davis announced last spring that he had rea= ched agreement with John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, the util= ity's parent corporation. The Edison deal was announced just a few days aft= er PG&E rejected Davis' overtures and took itself into bankruptcy court. Bo= th utilities ran up many billions of dollars in debts buying power in the l= ast six months of 2000 because the state rejected their pleas to raise reta= il rates.=20  Edison's -- or perhaps Bryson's -- fear of bankruptcy is another puzzling a= spect of the issue, given the almost cheerful manner in which PG&E placed i= tself in receivership. Edison has spent millions of dollars on lobbying, ad= vertising and other forms of political persuasion, trying to nudge the Legi= slature into passing a rescue plan that lawmakers are clearly reluctant to = do.=20  Is avoiding bankruptcy a matter of personal pride for Bryson? Or, as some s= uggest, does it stem from Edison's tardiness in erecting an impregnable fin= ancial fire wall between the utility's assets and those of the parent holdi= ng company, Edison International? Edison scrambled to build a fire wall aft= er bankruptcy loomed, but financial analysts are uncertain that it's as str= ong as PG&E's.=20  The dynamics within the Capitol and among various interest groups are equal= ly odd, following none of the patterns that usually explain why politicians=  do what they do. Legislators of both parties are all over the map on the E= dison issue, and factions that are ordinarily allied find themselves at odd= s. One example: Liberal consumer groups are strenuously opposing any bailou= t for the utility, while liberal environmentalists like the current scheme = because it would bring thousands of acres of Edison-owned Sierra watershed = under state control.=20  Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of the Edison situation is why Davis, or= dinarily the most cautious, commitment-averse of politicians, is making suc= h a crusade of keeping the utility out of bankruptcy court. Why would Davis=  put so much of his gubernatorial prestige behind such an iffy proposition = that exposes him to leverage from lawmakers seeking other favors from the g= overnor and, polls indicate, is not popular with voters?=20  Harvey Rosenfield, the consumer gadfly who has established a ""war room"" nea= r the Capitol to fight the Edison scheme, believes that Davis' unusual effo= rts stem from a desire to run for president in 2004 and a fear that Wall St= reet would blackball him if Edison follows PG&E into bankruptcy court.=20  Another possible explanation is Davis' decades-long relationship with Bryso= n. The two served together in former Gov. Jerry Brown's administration (Bry= son was Brown's Public Utilities Commission president) and both have strong=  ties to the Democratic political organization in West Los Angeles headed b= y Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman, who, in effect, allowed Davis to la= unch his career by winning a West Side state Assembly seat in 1982.=20  The most influential member of Edison's board of directors is Warren Christ= opher, a Democratic elder statesman and former secretary of state. Bryson a= nd Christopher flew to Sacramento late last year to plead with Davis to tak= e command of the energy crisis, allow utilities to raise rates and staunch = the red ink. Davis refused, and nearly a year later finds himself trying to=  keep Edison out of bankruptcy court.=20  We may never know why Davis is going to bat for Edison, but we will know, v= ery soon, whether he can pull it off or will wind up with egg on his face.= =20    _____ =20   The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or  ",dasovich-j

If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule. No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push. The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC. Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer). The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much ""headroom"" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements. Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective. All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (""ORA"") buy into the idea. I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA. On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.  Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

220,"The California PUC Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR. In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.  The Legislature The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee. It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today. Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers): Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers. Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions. There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions. Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill. So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions. After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03. Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges. Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line. Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis. At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.  ",dasovich-j

232,"FYI.  In case you hadn't seen it.  Interestingly, no mention of the transfer of the gas assets. Best, Jeff PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire  By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writers  (Published Sept. 21, 2001)  In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants.  To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials.  PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state ""bailout."" Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation.  The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan.  But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  FERC ""has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer,"" Davis told reporters Thursday.   Aronzon said of the plan.  Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money.  Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall",dasovich-j

He said that they will also be asking ESPs to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 9.20.01 and for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.

I asked if Edison would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1.

Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.

282,"The call was pretty tough.  Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement . At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it.  As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our ""share"" of the undercollection. Our ""share"" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years). In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back. Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection). We had a very ""animated"" discussion that went back and forth for some time.   I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track. Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid. Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our ""share"" of the undercollection. We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.  If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

315,"USA: Customer choice can boost 'green power' use-study. NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Giving consumers more energy supply choices could boost use of cleaner electricity sources by 40 percent by the end of the decade, regardless of whether the market is deregulated, a federal study said.  But there's a catch. While 10 percent of U.S. electricity already comes from hydro and another 2 percent comes from wind, solar and geothermal sources, stimulating alternative energy demand to meet the 40-percent goal will require more so-called green pricing programs, which are often more expensive to the consumer.  According to the study, pushing consumers to adopt electricity alternatives besides coal, oil, gas or nuclear will require utilities to offer green power choices. Indeed, the study showed some customers will 'go green' even if the price is higher than conventional sources.  ""Market research consistently shows that consumers prefer to receive their power from clean energy sources ... giving consumers energy supply choices can be a powerful mechanism for moving renewable energy into the marketplace,"" said Blair Swezey, co-author of the study.  Swezey works at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which conducted the study along with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Both organizations are U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories.  The study does not advocate competitive markets over regulated markets, but suggests utilities in states without competition should offer their customers green products.  ""If competitive retail markets fail to materialize, utility programs must pick up the slack,"" said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, another co-author of the study.  CALIFORNIA CAVEAT  Green power marketing had seen success in states with retail market competition, such as in California .  But in the wake of California 's heavily publicized deregulation crisis, the state seems to have backed away from deregulation, and green power has been one of the victims.    Wiser added, noting that at least until California makes up its mind regarding the fate of deregulation, green power programs will remain on the back-burner.  More than 85 utilities in 29 states out of more than 500 utilities nationwide give consumers the option to choose to buy power from renewable sources, meaning much of the potential growth for green power use has not yet materialized.  Non-hydro renewables provide about 2 percent, or 16,500 megawatts (MW), of all the electricity used in the United States. Hydropower provides about 10 percent.  With the expansion of customer choice, the study found the market could support about 6,000 MW of additional non-hydro renewables over the next decade.  National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is a research center for alternative fuels managed by Midwest Research Institute, technology developer Battelle and global engineering firm Bechtel.  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, of Berkeley, California , is a scientific research center managed by the University of California .",dasovich-j

320,"?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim. ?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell: 1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down;  2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC; 3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection.  4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH. 5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment. ?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options. ?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal. ?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC. ?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on. ?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).  If you have any questions, let us know.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
321,"Greetings Ms Kahl:  Few things:  1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial ""challenges."" 2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me? 3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its ""undercollection"" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the ""undercollection,"" would be ""responsible"" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.  One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?  Inquiring minds want to know.

354,"Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.  Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is. Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers. It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection. In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better. But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC). But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.  Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
355,"In California, all customers can choose--large and small.  There are core (small customer) and noncore (industrial customers).  Consumption volume differentiates the two.

There are requirements regarding storage requirements (customers must have some storage) and requirements to pay a share of past ""stranded costs"" caused by the move to competition.  And noncore customers on PG&E have more flexibility to buy in-state transportation than customers on SoCal have.  If there's anything else, let me know.  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j

There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference. The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th. The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday. In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues. At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings. Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.) The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues). Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.   Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity. Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.   The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.   As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue. The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., ""why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info,"" etc. From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.   In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in ""serious negotitations.""",dasovich-j

379,"No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j

Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money. The call was short and ended with an agreement that: 	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues,  	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and  	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position.  The salient quote in New West's ""supplemental"" PHC statement reads:  ""It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections.  Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission.""

444,"Hi Evie: As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing   The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a ""reasonable"" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.   At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.   I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.

448,"Dan:  I wanted to follow up on our discussion last week regarding the peaker we're helping Lodi to develop.  The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR. The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR. For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete. By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months. In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well. We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility. Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a ""special case"" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

496,"Steve:  Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.  On the plus side: He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills. He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the ""MOU"" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU. His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political ""center of gravity""--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.  On the negative side:  In each and every case that Rod has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first. Here are three examples (and there are more):   1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a ""stranded cost charge"" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill. 2)	In the ""alternative MOU"" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison. 3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.  Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.    Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

503,"Thanks so much for the call back.  Here it is.  It's got temperature and %RH from end of May to early November.  Couple of things.  I tried to keep and save heat days (cumulative) on the graph, but for some reason, it won't stick.  I'm assuming that you know how to add just about anything you want to the graph.  If not, let me know.   Also, the data should be cut off for about a week at both the front end and the back end (to account for the time that it was in my apartment prior to setting in up on the property, and before I was able to download it in November).  Once you get a chance to look at, give a call and let me know what you think.    If the temperature range looks like it's around the ballpark for vines, I'll want to get Terry Rosetti up to do some soil testing, but wanted to get your take on the temperature, etc. first.

513,"Janelle: Here's an email and slightly modified PP presentation that I'd like to send to Marcie.  Let me know what you think.  Best, Jeff  *********************************************************************************************************************************  Hi Marcie:  	Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  Elena tells me that you're having a great time.  	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.    	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.  Here are some of the program's highlights:  Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.  Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name.   Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities  Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.  Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.  Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses.   	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.  All the best, Jeff  ",dasovich-j

518,"Scott: Here are the foundations that ARM will use in its appeal of the PUC decision suspending DA (and threats to make it retroactive to July 1).  You should feel free to share with the business folks but under the condition that they keep it confidential.  And of course, we'd be thrilled if they'd sign on.  If you have any questions, just holler. Best, Jeff  The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows:  The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.  The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).  The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.  The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.  The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  The Decision's purported findings are not supported.  The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.",dasovich-j
519,"The ARM group is going back and forth on what they want to say in their filing on the specifics of the DA suspension (many parties with many interests).  There continues to be debates over the specifics.  Soon as there is a draft that folks have reasonably agreed to, I'll send it to you.  If you have any questions, give a holler.

535,"Greetings.  Well, it's about over for the company known as Enron.  Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.  But it should be viewed as an opportunity rather than something less positive.  It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.  But it is what it is.  As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around. I've already had a few calls from ""inquiring minds,"" so we'll we where things end up.

567,"Greetings.  Please forgive me for not getting back to you more promptly.  Here's the latest:  As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy. In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that. (I'd ask, ""what next?"", but I'm afraid to ask.....) However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize. OK, back to Enron. It's a mess (surprise). I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears. Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it. We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible. Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon. This week's a little tough just because with school and ""the mess,"" I'm a tad preoccupied. HOWEVER, your calls and nice thoughts are extremely welcomed and greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.  Will talk to you soon and hope you're doing well.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
568,"Greetings:  First, thanks for the pizza.    Second, in line with the ""role play"" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc..  Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project.  Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to ""beef up"" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well.  Whichever way you prefer is fine by us.  Just let me know.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
569,"Joseph:  Good news!  Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.  All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.  I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some ""beefing up.""

I'll give Hedy a call and see if they'd be willing to attend and report back. In my view, given the circumstances, if they've got conflicts and can't make it, I'm not inclinded to push it.

576,"Greetings Professor: I regret that I was unable to attend class last night.  Few items:  --I assume that you returned papers.  I will be on campus tomorrow and can pick it up then if you like.  Or if you'd prefer, you can drop it in my box in the student room at Haas (evening MBA boxes).  Or if you'd like to make some other arrangement, just let me know.  --I assume that our third paper is due by close-of-business on Wednesday, December 12.  Thanks very much.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
577,"Here's my take.  Alan's got an airplane ticket to go down and attend the lobbyist meeting.  From my perspective, there is very little value in that activity.  However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the ""Estate"" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.    Best, Jeff  ",dasovich-j

She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.  As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to ""compete"" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.  These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership.

681,"See story below.  State completes history's largest municipal-bond sale  California's treasurer executed the largest single sale of municipal bonds in U.S. history Tuesday -- a $5.7 billion offering aimed at covering cash shortages linked to the state's energy crisis.  The sale -- coming in an environment of record-low interest rates -- also proved to be the cheapest such short-term financing by the state on record.  And it provided a backdrop for a warning from state Treasurer Phil Angelides that continued delay in the long-awaited $12.5 billion energy-bond sale could wreak havoc with the state's budget in the next fiscal year.  With the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks delivering a blow to an already shaky economy, there is concern that state revenues may drop even more precipitously than they have in the past year, leading to a crunch for the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2002.  The slower state revenues coupled with increased expenditures and the added burdens of the ongoing energy crisis, could force ""Draconian"" budget cuts, Angelides said.  ""We were already facing tough budget times in 2002-2003,"" he said, ""and that was before the tragedy of Sept. 11.""  Now, if falling revenues are added to the ""$6 billion hole, we'll have deficits akin to the early 1990s,"" Angelides said, noting the dramatic effects would be on people who depend on state services.  Earlier this year, the state advanced $6.2 billion in general-fund money to buy wholesale power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.  Repayment to the state general fund depends on successful sale of the $12.5 billion in energy bonds -- a transaction Angelides said requires key approvals from the state Public Utilities Commission.  The huge energy-bond sale initially was proposed for this summer and then moved to late October or early November.  But the plan before the PUC has drawn heavy opposition from state utilities.  With utilities and others threatening lawsuits at every step of the way, regulators have needed time to build a legal record for each of the seven decisions the treasurer seeks, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Tuesday.  This year, ""we've been taken to court probably five times more than we've been taken to court last year,"" partly because the commission has been making historic decisions and partly because it's been trying to make them so fast, she said.  But Angelides said that given the delay in PUC action, he is doubtful an energy-bond sale can occur before 2002.  Besides raising the budget concerns, that also could mean that California misses an opportunity to capitalize on the very low interest rate environment.  ""I do not see a way now that this bond issue can happen this year,"" he said, citing the minimum 60 days of public notices and appeal periods that would follow PUC action.  Tuesday's bond sale to meet the state's cash-flow needs involved what are known as revenue anticipation notes.  The notes are fixtures on California's cash-flow landscape. In 1993-94, for example, the state sold $8 billion through multiple offerings. No such sale was held last year because the state had an adequate surplus.  But a year earlier, in fiscal 1999-2000, $1 billion in notes were sold to meet cash-flow needs.  Besides being the largest municipal-bond sale on record, Tuesday's sale was also the largest muni- and corporate-bond issuance since the terrorist strikes.  Tuesday's debt issuance was viewed widely as a success because the vast majority of the securities found buyers.  ""It speaks to overall quality of the state's credit and the way the state is perceived, particularly in light of Sept. 11,"" said Peter Taylor, senior vice president in the Los Angeles office of Lehman Bros.  As senior manager on the sale, Taylor and Lehman Bros. coordinated participation of more than 20 investment-banking firms.  ""There was wide acceptance from a range of investors, retail (buyers), mom-and-pop buyers all the way to mutual funds and corporations,"" Taylor said.  The level of orders exceeded the offering by more than $2 billion. That allowed yields to be lowered through negotiations from the 2.25 level initially proffered to the lowest RAN on record in the state, an annualized 2.22 percent.  The notes mature June 28, 2002. Overall yield, counting the variable-rate portion of the issuance, is only 2.17 percent.  Had the $6.2 billion in general-fund money been repaid, Angelides said, the need for Tuesday's short-term debt issuance ""would have been substantially less ... if not eliminated.""  Even so, Angelides said the state was fortunate to ""move into the market and get extraordinary interest rates, and we will be able to make it through this fiscal year.""",dasovich-j

In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.

693,"Probing the 'palace coup'  Electricity: A panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the ISO president.  September 26, 2001  By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register  SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.  The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: ""the palace coup.""  Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.  The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.  Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.  ""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn.  The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos.  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter.  ""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said.  Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps.  ""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said.  ""We had to take action.''  What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.  ""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March.  ""All hell broke loose.''  Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.  ""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III.  Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws.  In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.  The generators got their way.  The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier.  Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints.  They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.  What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.  Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.  Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it.  ""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said.  With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.   Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.'' ",dasovich-j

709,"FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.    Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC ""study"" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by ""green Senators"" to pass a ""green only"" DA bill.  In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.  The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.    We'll report back with news as we get it.  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j
710,"Riordan edges out Davis in Field Poll: A survey finds lingering damage from the governor's handling of the energy crisis. By Amy Chance Bee Political Editor (Published Sept. 26, 2001)  Gov. Gray Davis survived the summer without the widespread power blackouts his opponents predicted, but voters remained dissatisfied with his job performance and disinclined to re-elect him, a Field Poll released Tuesday found.  The poll showed Davis narrowly behind in a trial general election matchup against former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, 45 percent to 42 percent.  Riordan's strength in Los Angeles County -- rare for a Republican candidate -- as well as lingering damage to Davis from California's energy crisis were factors in the findings, said the poll's managing director, Mark DiCamillo.  ""It's an interesting situation for a sitting governor,"" he said. ""It's very unusual for a sitting governor to be denied re-election, but here we have a unique candidate coming out of a Democratic stronghold. And also we have this issue that is kind of hanging around the neck of the governor that the public is not very pleased about, and that's the energy and the electricity crisis.""  In a hypothetical Republican primary, Riordan led by a large margin over Secretary of State Bill Jones, 46 percent to 19 percent. Businessman Bill Simon trailed with 5 percent of the vote, while 30 percent was undecided.  The poll surveyed 1,003 Californians, including 722 registered voters, Sept. 7-10 and is subject to an overall error margin of 3.2 percent.  Davis political adviser Garry South said reporting poll results taken before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast was ""horribly misleading.""  ""These kinds of watershed events that shake the national psyche always have an effect on job approval,"" he said. ""These kinds of things have effects on the way people feel about incumbents in general.""  DiCamillo said he found it notable, however, that views of Davis' performance continued to lag even as voters worried less about the electricity crisis.  In May, at the peak of concern about potential power blackouts, voters said they disapproved of Davis' performance, 49 percent to 42 percent. In the latest survey, they continued to disapprove, 47 percent to 41 percent.  Voters also said they were not inclined to re-elect Davis, 50 percent to 43 percent.  ""Now we're in a situation where the energy crisis mentality has receded, yet the public's image of the governor has not changed,"" DiCamillo said. ""He has not benefited from the easing of public concern about the issue and is in the same situation that he found himself back in May.  ""No matter what the political temper of the times internationally, there will be issues that are particular to the governor's race. This issue is what the public has focused their attention on in evaluating Davis, and it's still negative.""  DiCamillo said he also was struck by the fact that the poll found Riordan leading among voters in Los Angeles County, 47 percent to 43 percent. He said the survey showed similar results in May. Los Angeles County accounts for one-quarter of the state's electorate, and Democrats typically carry it and the Bay Area by large margins, making up for losses in virtually every other area of the state.  Riordan adviser Dan Schnur said the numbers pose a strategic difficulty for Davis.  ""It's clear from this poll result that the voters who know Dick Riordan best support him most,"" he said.

740,"Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have. Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature. Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week. We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow. It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely. At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11. In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.  We'll report back with information as we get it.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

Angelides is trying to turn the screws on Loretta. ********************************************************************* Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit  NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002.  The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds.     Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement.  How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC.  Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows.  In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion.  The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s.  Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending.  Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion.  Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. ",dasovich-j

756,"Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis By Michael B. Marois  Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said.  The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said.  Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April.  The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan.  The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures Call of Special Session:  Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon.  Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals:  The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees.  Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications:  Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper.  Introduction of Special Session Bills:  There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session.  Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars:  There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the ""30-day in print"" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session.  Effective Date of Special Session Legislation:  Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature.  End of Special Session:  Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. ",dasovich-j

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.  Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc.   Best, Jeff    1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.    2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.  3.	No incremental ""DASR'ing"":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)  4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial.   Additional suggestions from Mike Day:  5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.  6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01. ",dasovich-j

Best, Jeff 8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged. By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL Times Staff Writers  September 30 2001  SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study.   The biggest problems are so-called ""take or pay"" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said.   The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups.   Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades.   Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state.   ""If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it,"" said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San Jose-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has ""no intention of asking for renegotiation"" on its own.   Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, ""I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction.""   And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. ""We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations,"" he said.   For his part, Gov. Gray Davis would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, Steve Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table.   ""Would we love to get a better deal?"" Maviglio said. ""Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table.""   S. David Freeman, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said.   ""Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit,"" said Freeman, ""but it's a good thing to have.""   But William B. Marcus, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined.   The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group.   The study singled out for criticism:   * A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San Diego Gas & Electric, which Marcus called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost.   The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not.   * A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be ""peakers,"" designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity.   ""They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million,"" said Marcus. ""That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much.""   * A deal with Alliance-Colton LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity.   * An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San Francisco Bay Area.   * A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed.   * Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said.   One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour.   But a second marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour.   ""When you compare those two contracts,"" Marcus said, ""you know you've got a dog here. I think Williams showed up earlier, and the state was desperate.""   * An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of Houston that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, Marcus said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go.   * A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.   Marcus, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer.   Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices.   ""The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty,"" said V. John White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ""To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas.""   When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire.   Marcus was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring.   Another weakness of the contracts, Marcus said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said.   Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added.   ""I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy,"" Marcus said.   ""I don't want to pay Williams $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin.""

Best, Jeff  State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts  Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators  In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis.  The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut.  ""The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,"" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. ""I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down.""  The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  ""It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts.  Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices.  ""It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,"" Hidalgo said. ""If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up.""  The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30.  Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases.  Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher.  SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity.  The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company.  Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts.  Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions.  The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees.  The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue.  STATE TREASURER'S WARNING State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year.  PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer.  ""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible.  Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts.  Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said.  ""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract.""  Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable.  Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations.  ""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored.""  PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says.  ""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said.  An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal.  Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing.  While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.  *************************************************** ",dasovich-j

809,"Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday.  The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void.""  Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed.  ""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover.""  The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release.  The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday.  The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday.

810,"Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.  Summary of our offer: Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01. Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%. In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC. In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.  Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal: Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates. Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals. Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.  We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.  Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.  Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

827,"  SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR   The Bond Structure ? Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power purchase revenues and no other repayment source. ? Designed as a ""net revenue bond,"" meaning bondholders are paid last and all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1) carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off the bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by ratepayers for 15 years. ? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs for the life of the bonds.   ? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the bonds are outstanding.   The Rate Agreement ? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends over a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates established at a level that satisfies DWR. ? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each service territory.  ? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the requirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.   ? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program ""sunset"" at the end of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about this provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through Commission-approved revenue requirements. ? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the State. ? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term contracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts. ? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR. ? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds are issued.",dasovich-j

This year's theme,   is embodied by two exceptional keynote speakers: Donna Dubinsky, founder, president, and CEO of Handspring, and Beth Sawi, chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.   The annual WIL conference is the longest-running student-run conference at Haas. Last year it attracted more than 400 participants including current MBA and undergraduate students, alumni, and career women from the greater Bay Area.  Dubinsky gives the first keynote address of the day. She co-founded Handspring with Jeff Hawkins in July 1998 to create a new breed of hand-held computers for consumers. Before joining Handspring Dubinsky served as president and CEO of Palm Computing, where she helped make the Palm Pilot the best-selling hand-held computer and the most rapidly adopted new computing product ever produced. When Dubinsky first joined Hawkins at Palm Computing in 1992, shortly after the company was founded, she brought with her more than ten years of marketing and logistics experience from Apple and Claris. Dubinsky and Hawkins introduced the original Palm Pilot in February 1996, a move that revitalized the hand-held computing industry. She earned her BA from Yale University and her MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.  Beth Sawi oversees Human Resources, Corporate Communications, Community Affairs, Legal, Compliance, Internal Audit, and Corporate Services. She is also a member of the executive committee for The Charles Schwab Corporation. She will give the afternoon keynote address.   Sawi is a long-time veteran of Schwab; she started her career at Schwab in 1982. From 1995 to 1997 she was executive vice president of Electronic Brokerage, during which time she headed Schwab's Internet launch. Sawi took a sabbatical in Italy in 1998-99 during which she wrote her book   published by Hyperion in February 2000. She received a BA from Tufts University and an MBA from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.   Throughout the day, conference attendees will interact with leaders from a variety of professional backgrounds through the conference's panel sessions and workshops. Panels planned for this year's conference include:  + Management Techniques to Inspire and Motivate  + Women and the New Economy - Women in the Tech World  + International Business  + Wild Women   This year's conference is sponsored by Fortune, Ford, Chevron, Genentech, J.P.

Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.  With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.  Thanks for your time and hope all is well.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

853,"In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC. The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.  What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.  What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months. Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January. In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds. Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles.  What Next? A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support. The bill would create a ""dedicated rate component"" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue. Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget. The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result. All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it. Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel. Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.  Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another ""special"" session next Tuesday.

860,"In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:  The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005. Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection. Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off. Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B. Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk. Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place. Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.

861," PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: ?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap. ?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment. ?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers. ?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt.  ?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs. ?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003.  ?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities. ?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually. ""This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,"" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  ""The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."" This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

886,"Edison To Repay Creditors 'Immediately,' But No Date Yet LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Embattled utility Southern California Edison expects to pay all creditors ""immediately,"" but the Edison International (EIX) unit does not have a specific date of when its debt payments will begin, said John Bryson, chairman and chief executive of Edison International.  ""We intend to pay all of our creditors,"" Bryson said Wednesday in a call with reporters. ""But we do not have a specific date.""  Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission struck a deal Tuesday that will allow the utility to pay off $3.3 billion of its $3.9 billion debt through existing retail electricity rates.  Both parties settled a year-old lawsuit Southern California Edison filed against the PUC--otherwise known as a filed rate doctrine--that could have ended a retail rate freeze and allowed the utility to recover more than $5 billion in wholesale power costs from ratepayers.  The settlement must still be approved by a federal court judge. A ruling is expected by Thursday.  Bryson indicated that the utility may try to negotiate with some large generators, owed nearly $1 billion, to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar for money the companies are owed.  ""There is no deal between us and the generators at this point,"" Bryson said. ""We will engage promptly"" in settlement discussions. ""We are eager to work it out in a tough minded and fair way.""  Ted Craver, Edison's chief financial officer, said the utility has between $2.4 and $2.5 billion cash-on-hand and about $3.9 billion in debt.  Bryson said the utility does not expect its credit ratings to be restored to investment grade ""immediately.""  ""We've had some discussions with the credit rating agencies,"" Bryson said. ""But no one expects it to be restored immediately. It's going to take some time.""  Bryson added that the utility will seek new lending opportunites, but he did not elaborate.",dasovich-j

904,"Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals  SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus.  This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs.  In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business.  Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases.  But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout.  As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity.  Or maybe not.  While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled.  Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals.  Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need.  ""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal.""  Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation.  Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California.  ""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added.  ""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said.  Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis.  Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said.  Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place.  He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices.  ""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency.""  The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period.  ""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC. Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC.  The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis.  Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC.  For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts.  ""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.""  Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements.  Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements.  ""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp.  The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California.  Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture.  San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state.  Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices.  ""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said.  But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources.  White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing.  ""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered.  ""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?""  ***************************************************************** State authority buying more power for 2002  Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss  OC Register, 10.07.01 SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices.  Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year.  The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators.  Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run.  ""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports.  A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year.  Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are.  In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus.  Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member.  Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.""  New contracts would increase 'green' power  In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said.  Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent.  The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages.  The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes.  Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February.  ""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group.  Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them  Even the state's businesses are critical.  They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there.  Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate.  Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system.  ""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.  The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis.  The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month.  ""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.''  Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state.  Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work.  ""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''",dasovich-j

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said.  Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis.  Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said.  Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place.  He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices.  ""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency.""  The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period.  ""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC. Willingness to deal At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC.  The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis.  Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC.  For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts.  ""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone.""  Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements.  Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements.  ""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp.  The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California.  Sempra says contract fair The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture.  San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state.  Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices.  ""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said.  But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources.  White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing.  ""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered.  ""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?""  ***************************************************************** State authority buying more power for 2002  Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss  OC Register, 10.07.01 SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices.  Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year.  The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators.  Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run.  ""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports.  A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year.  Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are.  In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus.  Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member.  Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks.""  New contracts would increase 'green' power  In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said.  Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent.  The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages.  The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes.  Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February.  ""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group.  Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them  Even the state's businesses are critical.  They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there.  Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate.  Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system.  ""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.  The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis.  The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month.  ""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.''  Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state.  Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work.  ""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''",dasovich-j
907,"FYI. Looks like Brown might not be getting the presidency right away....  Best, Jeff  **************************************************** PUC Chief's Iron Resolve Evident in Edison Deal Politics: Insisting on her agency's independence, Loretta Lynch repeatedly stood up to the governor who appointed her. SACRAMENTO -- Once again last week, California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch gave Gov. Gray Davis help that he badly needed--but left him upstaged.  With the governor unable to broker a deal to save Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, Lynch and commission lawyers secretly negotiated a $3.3-billion settlement that was ratified by a federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday.  Although Davis appointed Lynch as PUC president, she and administration officials say she informed the administration of the talks only after they were well underway. ""I will take responsibility,"" Lynch said.  Even as she took the lead in forging an Edison deal, Lynch defied the governor Tuesday. She led the PUC in rejecting a measure that Davis and Treasurer Phil Angelides deem necessary for repaying the state for billions of dollars in power purchases this year. Davis condemned the vote as ""an irresponsible act.""  Davis repeatedly has said he wants people he appoints to think and act as he would act. Lynch, however, is not easily controlled. She has moved ahead without the governor's approval several times. Most notably, last spring, she pushed the largest electricity rate increase in state history through the PUC while Davis was publicly opposed to a rate hike.  Such actions have made her perhaps Davis' least favorite appointee.  And yet, Lynch holds the key to resolving what now is Davis' single most pressing issue: how to reimburse the state for the billions spent on electricity since January.  For months, those power purchases have been eating a huge hole in the state treasury. Unless a way is found to close it, Davis may have to make deep cuts in public services next year just as he prepares to run for reelection. He has proposed reimbursing the treasury with a $12.5-billion bond issue that would be paid off by electricity consumers.  Davis would not discuss Lynch for this article. But his aides say there is so much tension between the two that the governor and Lynch talk only through intermediaries. A top aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the governor's relationship with Lynch, who once served on Davis' staff, as ""nonexistent.""  But floating the bond deal requires action by the PUC, and Davis aides admit that figuring out a way to do that means dealing with Lynch, whose term does not expire until 2005 and whose influence is now stronger than ever, according to fellow commissioners and others familiar with the agency.  Davis could demote Lynch from PUC president to just commissioner, but ""he can't remove commissioners,"" said the Davis aide who described the tension between the two. ""We are in a position where we're going to have to negotiate.""  A Yale-educated attorney who practiced in San Francisco before joining the administration, Lynch worked on Davis' 1998 campaign, helping him raise money. He rewarded her loyalty by making her head of the Office of Research and Planning, then placing her on the PUC in late 1999.  Lynch has taken seriously the idea, enshrined in the early 20th century laws that created the PUC, that the commission is supposed to be independent.  She recalls spending Christmas 1999 reading the Public Utilities Code, written 90 years ago, and concluding that Progressive Gov. Hiram Johnson envisioned ""an independent agency, independent from the Legislature as well as from the governor, [that] would allow regulators in a highly technical field to do essentially the right thing.""

910,"Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals  In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus.  This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs.  In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business.  Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases.  But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout.  As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity.  Or maybe not.  While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled.  Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals.  Duress alleged Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need.  ""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal.""  Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation.  Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California.  ""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added.

921,"Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor? When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers.  All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the ""energy crisis,"" an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather.  When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis.  Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly.  At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position.  Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases.  Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad.  A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis.  That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain.  By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again.  Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging.  Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.",dasovich-j

It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible. **************************************************************************  Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",dasovich-j

(EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California .  The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants.  ""While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power,"" Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday.  The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation.  In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's ""standards of conduct"" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates.    he said.",dasovich-j

956,"California's $12.5 Bln Bond Sale May Be Salvaged, Official Says Sacramento, California, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- California's $12.5 billion bond sale to cover energy costs may win approval if Governor Gray Davis agrees to seek revisions of existing power contracts, a state regulatory official said.  The bond sale stalled last week when the California Public Utilities Commission voted 4-1 against a plan to repay the state's power costs using utility rates. The commissioners favor another approach, opposed by Davis, that would give them more authority over the state's $43 billion of power contracts.  Some commissioners ``would probably be amenable to the rate agreement if there was movement on the governor's part to renegotiate those contracts,'' said Geoffrey Brown, who was appointed to the PUC by Davis. ``We're not just sitting around waiting for the sky to fall. There's got to be some give here.''  Moody's Investors Service on Friday said California's $31.6 billion of debt may be downgraded for the second time this year, in part because of the delayed bond sale. California's budget deficit in fiscal 2003 may reach $9.3 billion if energy costs aren't repaid, state Treasurer Philip Angelides said.  The state has spent $10.4 billion since January buying electricity on behalf of PG&E Corp. and Edison International utilities, which are insolvent.  Davis `Willing to Discuss'  ``It takes two to tango and we are certainly willing to discuss the contracts,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman.  Davis will consider Brown's offer, ``especially in context'' of any refunds from generators that may be ordered, Maviglio said. State officials claim power generators have charged too much, and are asking federal regulators to order refunds.  Power generators are ``willing to discuss it, but I wouldn't want anybody to have any false promise or hope that any enormous change will come from this,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing power sellers. Any companies willing to talk ``might want something else in return, and who knows what that might be.''  The planned bond sale, the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history, would repay the state's general fund for a $6.1 billion power loan and cover other power costs. The sale has been delayed by the disagreements among state leaders.  `A Blank Check'  Under state law, the PUC is required to provide enough revenue from consumer rates to meet the bond payments and cover power contracts. The Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying the power, has sole authority to determine its revenue needs.  PUC President Loretta Lynch and others said an irrevocable financing order would make it difficult for the state to renegotiate power contracts. They also said the DWR has been given too much authority. In the past, the PUC has set utility rates.  ``It gives a blank check to the DWR for anything that they want to do going forward,'' said California Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton.  The commissioners favor a plan to back the bonds with a surcharge on utility customers' bills. The proposal would let the PUC review the water department's revenue requirements and require a public hearing on the allocation of costs among the utilities. Davis opposes that plan.  ``It's dead on arrival. It's still going to be vetoed,'' said Maviglio. The governor has until Sunday to sign or veto all the bills sent to him during the last session.  The new plan would expose the state to breach-of-contract claims, the governor's office said in a statement last week. The state agreed with power generators to pay energy contracts before repaying the bonds. Making a change now ``would eliminate the security on which the power sellers relied'' the governor's office said in the statement.  Critics of the long-term power contracts say the state's economy will be hurt by above-market costs for years to come.  No matter which approach the state takes, ``the government ought to try to renegotiate the contracts anyway,'' Burton said. ``And some of the generators have said they're willing to do it.''

958,"PG&E utility reorganization draws fire in Calif  SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 10 (Reuters) - PG&E Corp.'s plan to reorganize its bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric unit, California's biggest utility, is coming under fire as a bid to dodge state regulation.  Critics said that with California beginning to emerge from a two-year energy crisis triggered by a failed deregulation law that drowned the state's utilities in red ink, now is no time to abandon state oversight.  Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), called the plan ""a regulatory jailbreak"" and ""a corporate shell game to evade proper state regulation"" by transferring assets to unregulated PG&E affiliates.  The reorganization plan would split the parent company and its utility into stand-alone companies, transferring the hydro network, Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant and gas and electric transmission systems to unregulated units of parent PG&E.  The utility would continue to own and operate local gas and power distribution grids serving about 13 million customers.  The plan would allow all valid creditor claims to be paid without the need for a rate increase or state bailout, said Bob Glynn, chairman, president and chief executive of PG&E.  It would provide creditors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes.  EYE ON HYDRO SYSTEM  One of the concerns arising from the plan is how Pacific Gas & Electric would continue to manage its hydroelectric properties, which make up the world's largest privately held hydropower system.  Elected officials from 28 counties in PG&E's sprawling hydro watershed in central and northern California will meet Friday to weigh actions on the reorganization plan filed at the San Francisco federal bankruptcy court Sept. 20.  The Regional Council of Rural Counties is worried about who will safeguard the environmental health of the hydro system's rivers and lakes that are the foundation for fishing, boating and tourism in an area that sprawls across about two-thirds of the state, council vice president Wes Lujan told Reuters.  PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said the hydro system, nuclear reactors and transmission systems would continue to be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  The utility also would continue to get power from plants it now owns under a 12-year deal at 5 cents per kilowatt hour.  But State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he is looking closely at the plan because of ""serious concerns the utility is seeking to evade further scrutiny by the CPUC"" and avoid state laws on the asset transfers.  Lockyer said that in the past, PG&E had used CPUC oversight as a shield against federal scrutiny.  Despite PG&E's claim that the CPUC has no jurisdiction on the transfer of power and transmission assets to the parent, CPUC chief counsel Gary Cohen said the agency's approval is required under state law.  'FIRE SALE PRICES'  ""PG&E's goal is clear. They want to transfer most of the utility's valuable assets to an affiliate company, at fire sale prices, so that they will no longer be subject to any state regulation. It is a deregulation plan, not a reorganization plan,"" Cohen said.  ""PG&E's plan conflicts with California's interest to have a more stable and regulated energy system. Deregulation has failed the public, and we will look at every opportunity to put down this attempt to solve the failure of deregulation with more deregulation,"" said Doug Heller, of consumer advocate The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.  PG&E's Tremayne said the plan makes the most sense for California because units of PG&E would continue to own and manage power production and transmission.  Tremayne said, however, the reorganization plan does not bar a future sale to another company.  PG&E's plan would give the utility $4.5 billion from the asset transfers to help pay off about $13 billion in debts, including $9 billion in unrecovered power purchase costs.  The CPUC's Cohen and consumer groups said PG&E should receive far more than $4.5 billion from the assets.  They point to the value of the hydro network. Last fall, the utility dropped a plan to sell the hydro system to its parent for $2.8 billion because the system was ""undervalued in today's market"" and could fetch a much higher price through an auction.  The PG&E utility and Edison International's Southern California Edison utility amassed billions of dollars of debt because the deregulation law prevented them from passing steep wholesale power prices to their customers.  SoCal Edison and the CPUC reached a deal Oct. 2 to keep the utility out of the bankruptcy court and pay off its creditors. ",dasovich-j

969,"FYI.  Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said.  The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman.  ""We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,"" Soderberg said.  No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts.  The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts.  The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts.  Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said.  California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.

970,"Davis devises new borrowing plan  His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism.  SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy crisis.  The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator, the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it declined to sign off on his original plan.  With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining issues of the energy crisis.  ""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be publicly announced.""  Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell $12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before they could be marketed to investors.  Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes.  The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue.  The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch.  Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure investors and get the bonds to market.  The plan now under review, however, would bypass that.  The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers' utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect, guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe that would satisfy Wall Street.  The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes.  Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates.  ""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,"" Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of those two things.""  The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco.  Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies' contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute.  If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall in other income. ",dasovich-j

Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings  Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal.  Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal.  The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric.  At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis.  Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November.  The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates.  Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis.  Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt.  Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions.  In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt.  Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan.  ""There is $400 million at stake here,"" Shames said.  SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt.  A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan.  Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis.  Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be ""just and reasonable.""  The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said.  ""If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family,"" Lynch said.  She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.",dasovich-j

1010,"Interesting.  What right does the PG&E creditor committee have to either 1) ask PG&E whether it's begun talks--informal or otherwise--with the PUC, and/or 2) request that PG&E begin talks?  I'm assuming that there may be some chance for #1, but very little, if any, for #2.  Thanks. Best, Jeff Edison pact could point way for PG&E  The multibillion-dollar settlement between Southern California Edison and California regulators could ultimately ripple well beyond homes and businesses in the south state.  It might form rough outlines for a deal that could pull Pacific Gas and Electric Co. out of bankruptcy without removing its assets from state regulation.  The pact between Edison and the California Public Utilities Commission also might presage a nimbler PUC, one likelier to strike closed-door deals without its typical months of testimony, briefs and hearings.  Along with its statewide impacts, which may not fully unfold for years, the settlement with the state's second-largest utility also raises uncertainties for its customers, who will pay billions to retire its debts.  One week after a federal judge approved the $6.35 billion pact to restore Edison to financial health after wholesale power costs spiraled out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that much of the cost will be born by south state consumers.  From the start, the Edison rescue plan was a stealth settlement.  It was negotiated in secret, approved in a closed meeting and so murky that days afterward, even some PUC analysts were still debating just how much money was involved.  ""It's definitely ambiguously worded,"" said Steve Linsey, a supervisor in the PUC's semi-independent Office of Ratepayer Advocates. On his first review of the deal, he thought about $1.7 billion would be paid by customers through future electric rates. But that figure will be at least $3.3 billion and probably higher, according to Edison and those who negotiated the deal for the PUC.  ""There seems to be a lot of off-the-books interpretation in a direction that is unfavorable to ratepayers,"" Linsey said.  The PUC settlement emerged after the Senate and Assembly deadlocked over how much money should flow to Edison and what other benefits should be included for the company and some of its customers.  In addition, the PUC gave Edison permission to use small and large customers' rates to collect much of the money to pay off back debts, bypassing legislative bargaining to shield residential consumers.  And the PUC settlement took a much broader view of Edison's finances, sweeping in old debts and cash on hand, and then basically authorized a blueprint to pay off $6.35 billion in debts.  About three-fourths of that amount -- $4.9 billion -- appears to come from the utility's customers.  Edison's investors will pick up $1.5 billion -- $1.2 billion through eliminating shareholder dividends for three years, and $300 million as a company contribution.  The clearest-cut customer contribution flows into a $3.3 billion pot to be filled by future electric bills, probably through the end of 2003. But that's not their only contribution.  Another $1.6 billion would come from Edison's cash on hand, which includes money already collected from rates and loans that will eventually be repaid by customers.  ""In the end, you're right, the vast sum of money here comes from ratepayers,"" said Brian Bennett, Edison vice president of external affairs.  But if Edison had won its suit, Bennett said, it would have been entitled to the full $6.35 billion, without its shareholders taking any hit at all.  No one can know who would have won the Edison suit. Both sides say they had compelling legal arguments. So why did the PUC, after maintaining publicly for months that it would prevail, chose to settle?  Partly, the commission was getting gloomy forecasts from the law firm it had hired, said PUC commissioner Richard Bilas. But he and others said there was another, looming fear.  The PG&E bankruptcy reorganization plan, filed Sept. 20, called for shifting utility assets, including the company's hydroelectric plants, nuclear plant, and gas storage and pipeline network, to a firm free from state regulation.  ""People's calculus was shaken up by what PG&E did,"" said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. ""It was just in the ether that 'oh God, there's something really ugly out there. We don't think they can get away with it, but we're not entirely sure.'""  The reorganization plan would leave a new PG&E company free to set its own rates for power that its plants produce.  That prospect horrifies regulators and lawmakers who have watched unregulated generators set market prices so high they crippled PG&E and Edison.  They plan to fight PG&E's efforts, and one of their key tools could be showing the judge that the PUC has been able to salvage Edison while keeping it regulated.  ""They could say, 'judge, you don't have to do this bad deal that PG&E wants. We can work it out,'"" said Randy Chinn, an adviser to state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey.  For its part, PG&E maintains that the PUC should have helped it out last fall with something similar to the Edison deal. But now, the utility said, it prefers its bankruptcy reorganization plan.  PUC chief counsel Gary Cohen predicts that if the utility's efforts are rejected by the bankruptcy judge, PG&E will have to begin consultations with regulators for some sort of solution.  ""I think it would be smarter to be talking now,"" he said.  A PG&E rescue wouldn't follow the Edison settlement exactly because PG&E's debts and costs are higher, Cohen said, but the PUC's goal would be the same goal it held for Edison: a healthy, regulated utility.  Consumer groups have blasted the settlement for funneling money to Edison after the utility was allowed to essentially pad its bills during the late 1990s to position itself for deregulation. A PUC majority took a similar stance for more than a year -- until the Edison settlement.  ""We finally got to the point where we said look, we've seen the alternatives, and the alternatives are something like what PG&E is trying to do, or having the state take over the business of buying power,"" Cohen said.  Most people at the commission, he said, concluded that a regulated utility looks much more appealing than unregulated power plants or the state Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for cash-strapped utilities since January.  Cohen, who orchestrated the Edison settlement negotiations, said they had to be kept quiet for fear that a leak could trigger a bankruptcy filing. Bilas said if it had leaked, so many people would have tried to stop the deal that it likely would have been torpedoed.  At a closed session before approving it, he said, every commissioner worried aloud that they were sidestepping their own frequent calls for due process, full information and proper hearings.  It is far too early to say whether more closed door deals will follow. Bilas, Florio and others predict the current PUC has little taste for them. But the five-member commission continues to evolve each time a term expires and the governor appoints a new commissioner.  ""It scares the hell out of me what a really pro-utility commission would do with this,"" said Florio, the consumer advocate. ""This could be the beginning of something really ugly.""  In addition, if utilities see federal suits as way to slice through time-consuming PUC procedures, a flurry of suits could follow, said Linsey of the Ratepayer Advocates' Office.",dasovich-j

Sort of thought-provoking.  Best, Jeff  October 11, 2001 Commentary Even Pacifists Must Support This War  By Scott Simon, the host of National Public Radio's    Von Ribbentrop sent back the good news to Germany's new chancellor, Hitler: The West will not fight for its own survival. Its finest minds will justify a silent surrender.  In short, the best-educated young people of their time could not tell the difference between the deficiencies of their own nation, in which liberty and democracy were cornerstones, and a dictatorship founded on racism, tyranny and fear.  And what price would those who urge reconciliation today pay for peace? Should Americans impose a unitary religious state, throw women out of school and work, and rob other religious groups of their rights, so that we have the kind of society the attackers accept? Do pacifists really want to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade Center and Pentagon would make?  Pacifists do not need any lectures about risking their lives to stop wickedness. Quakers resisted slavery by smuggling out slaves when even Abraham Lincoln tried to appease the Confederacy. Pacifists sneaked refugee Jews out of Germany when England and the U.S. were still trying to placate Hitler. Many conscientious objectors have served bravely in gritty and unglamorous tasks that aided the U.S. in time of war.  But those of us who have been pacifists must admit that it has been our blessing to live in a nation in which other citizens have been willing to risk their lives to defend our dissent. The war against terrorism does not shove American power into places where it has no place. It calls on America's military strength in a global crisis in which peaceful solutions are not apparent. Only American (and British) power can stop more killing in the world's skyscrapers, pizza parlors, embassies, bus stations, ships, and airplanes. Pacifists, like most Americans, would like to change their country in a thousand ways. And the blasts of Sept. 11 should remind American pacifists that they live in that one place on the planet where change -- in fact, peaceful change -- seems most possible. It is better to sacrifice our ideals than to expect others to die for them.",dasovich-j

1071,"In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing."" The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions. Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial. In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects. Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.   Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds. The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below. If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.  Best, Jeff  ""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21",dasovich-j

1084,"Chris: A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday): A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim. After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.)  We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.   In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution. We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.) For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs. We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC.   With respect to what else we could offer them: From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge. One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.) Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective. One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.   This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors. The ""note"" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.  Hope this helps.  Best, Jeff ",dasovich-j

Angelides ends the lettery by urging the Commission to immediately roll back the DA suspension date to July 1.  The concern, of course, is that Angelides' assertions are out there and have received alot of press attention, i.e., Direct Access=$8 billion tax on homeowners.    To her credit, Loretta refuted Angelides in the press accounts and repeated that the best way to get costs down is to renegotiate the DWR contracts.  She also said in the press accounts that she intends to deal with the July 1/September 20 suspension issue at the next commission meeting.  In light of these events (and the increasing attacks on Loretta by Angelides and others in the Administration) It might be useful to give Loretta an assist by drafting a very brief letter to her stating:  Angelides is all wet--DA and ""fairness"" are not mutually exclusive and the PUC has all the regulatory tools necessary to ensure fairness is maintained going forward.  Thus, the 8 plus billion dollar number is without basis. Re-stating that the PUC has no legal authority to retroactively suspend DA to July 1, etc., etc.  Folks may have other points to make.

Best, Jeff CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKETS  Friday, October 19, 2001 [1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash  After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority  is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature  looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its  monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing  its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism  from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority  escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and  fuel cells at [18].  [18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority  (from [1])  Is the California Power Authority a dangerously  out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting  back some state control over electricity supplies?  The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the  Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter  and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1.  The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember  Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair  of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob  Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal  authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion,  SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the  Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping  the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly  the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany,  Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy  Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps  between Capstone and the Energy Foundation.  Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer  Power and Conservation Financing Authority.  Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and  heads of other agencies the Power Authority must  work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose  Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector  of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed  Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal  to have it buy peaker output. California Energy  Commission members said they are at policy odds  with the Power Authority's siting plans.  In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said  that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil  peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not  able to respond quickly enough to balancing power  needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the  Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb  that power given the outlook for net-short need.""  Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority  power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling  on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said  Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha.  The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently  in the position of actually being able to acquire  new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to  underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in  limbo and the California Independent System Operator  is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority  cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic  house in order, and an Assembly investigation might  jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].  [",dasovich-j
1147,10-ish percent.  ,dasovich-j
1148,"FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy. Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY  Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed  Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible.  Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved.  Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts.  Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind.  With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves?  Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State.  Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.  Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer  William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento.

1159,"Great question.  If you think it would be useful, I can back channel to Loretta and find out.  I'm of the view that this letter is more to refute Angelides, so that his wild assertions don't go unanswered in the court of public opinion.  Perhaps the letter should be addressed to Angelides, instead.    On the other hand, I think it is also useful to make it known to the press and the public that the PUC has the regulatory tools, processes, etc. necessary to permit customers broad latitude to manage their own energy needs on the one hand, and ensure that there's not the sort of massive cost-shifting to which Angelides refers on the other.  In the public's view this has been painted as an either/or issue. Either we end direct access, or granny faces death and destruction.  And that's just not the case. In fact, I think it can be argued that the scenario Angelides paints just isn't in the cards, period.    But I may be missing the mark with all this and am open to other views.

Be happy to discuss further.  Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area. Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature. Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs). Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like. In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated. When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities. Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition. And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led. Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

Best, Jeff ************************************************************************************** California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds.  The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November.  The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity .  Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations.  Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds.  Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission.  From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority.  He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program.  In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually.

1195,"I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:  They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02. Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP. He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only. In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.) I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed. He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing. Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next. It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.  If you have any questions, let us know.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

1229,"Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter   LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday.   The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said.   In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said.   Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said.   The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total.   According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market.   The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years.   Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices.   The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said.   The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. ",dasovich-j

1289,"Governor wants to cut costs of power  Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk  By Steve Geissinger SACRAMENTO BUREAU  SACRAMENTO -- With an economic ""perfect storm"" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians.  But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state.  ""If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?"" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power.  And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities.  ""Good luck!"" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan.  Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit.  The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades.  ""This could save billions of dollars,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan.  Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is ""not targeting every contract"" because the pacts have been ""extremely valuable in keeping the market stable.""  The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state.  The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year.  The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years.  Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses.  The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year.  The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing ""perfect storm"" of fiscal calamities.  The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts.  The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC.  Burton has called ""for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts.""  The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history.  Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials.  The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast.  Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both.  But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes.  The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers.  ""We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'"" said Calpine's Cartwright.  If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be ""very, very severe,"" but also ""they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,"" Cartwright said.  His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state.  Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis ""is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts.""  ""Last spring,"" Heller said, ""power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals.""",dasovich-j

1299,"With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:  Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts. Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal. Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.  We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j
1300,"Couple of additional pieces of information:  In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward. It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).   So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.

1312,"Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).   In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.   That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
1313,"FYI.  My understanding is that the decisions would actually go out prior to Aug. , with ""effective date"" in Aug., , thus providing time for the appeals process.  Do others have a similar or different view?

1315,"Here's the proposal:  There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the ""state of emergency"" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end. The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.) If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

1322,"Greetings:  Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.  I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.  The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan. 17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt from paying for the bonds.   In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.    For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?

1348,"Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					  The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session. The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.  The Legislature's options:  1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning. 2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning. 3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.  In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.  Where to from here? Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July. Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.""  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.   Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough. With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive. Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said: Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses."" He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session."" With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.  If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.  We'll report back with additional information as we get it.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

Best, Jeff ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Campaign funds will pay for spots  Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 7, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political campaigning has become a permanent sport.  Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an ""information void"" among Californians about what the state has accomplished. But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis.  ""The campaign season has started early,"" said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots running since June 19.  Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an ""energy update,"" where the governor informs listeners that ""we"" have licensed 16 new power plants, including three Davis opened this month, and that ""conservation is the best way to fight back against high energy prices.""  Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed   Gillespie said.  E-mail Robert Salladay at  ",dasovich-j

1360,"Below is an update from the weekend's activities.  The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.   The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT). The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday). As expected, some in the group are attempting to ""recontract"" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially. Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

1374,"Folks: Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.  They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as ""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.  Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.  In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., ""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.  Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.  Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).  Best, Jeff   ",dasovich-j

Anticipated that Edison might not want to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.  Thanks very much for the comments.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to go along.  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the core/noncore proposal. Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is uncertain. No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that he wants to ""give it a chance.""

1462,"Nov 16,2000  California Power Plants Get Jolt As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut  By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal    LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their  limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp  curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.   The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce  electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns  that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is  putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.   That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.  burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to  shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were  constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel  flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than  gas and generally has been costlier.   In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San  Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow  new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies  last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to  solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now,  they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical  problem and into a gas problem.   One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single  fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a  comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas  and electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants  and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter, chief  executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the  organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies.  ""You  can't look at these things in isolation.""   The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,  San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of  industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In  California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas,  and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating  plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the  older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't  like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when  they  burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power   plants here need to operate.   The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short  of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including  many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair  after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.   What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to  begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and  not big power plants.   The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because  gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation,  but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last  summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of  gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices  also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal  units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8%  from a year ago.   ""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,"" said  John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of  Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based  on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.    High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In  California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was  $228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the  price a year earlier. ",dasovich-j

1471,"Despite Its Depressed Stock, Commerce One Prepares for Blastoff By Joe Bousquin  Staff Reporter 8/31/00 1:15 PM ET  URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1062174.html  Poor Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq). Despite its best efforts, including  Wednesday's 21% gain, it's still less than half the stock it used to be.  Trading at about $63 a share, it's well off its split-adjusted high of  $165.50, reached near the end of last year. Meanwhile, archrival Ariba (ARBA :Nasdaq), at about $150 a share, has steadily been marching back toward its  all-time high of $183.31. It has jumped 47% since reporting its earnings on  July 12.  But as Wednesday's move may indicate, it may be Commerce One's turn. People  are beginning to pay attention to the strength of its partnership with  Germany's SAP (SAP:NYSE ADR). An exchange that Commerce One is helping build  for the big automakers is about to crank up. And perhaps more importantly,  some observers are beginning to see some value in Commerce One's focus on  so-called direct B2B, which involves buying and selling major supplies like  steel for cars instead of office supplies.  Issues Aplenty Of course, there are still plenty of issues facing Commerce One, the same  issues that have held its stock down. For instance, it carries the stigma of  being a concept stock because no one knows whether those same big industry  exchanges actually will work. Its sluggish stock also puts it at a  disadvantage to chief competitor Ariba when it comes to making acquisitions  to grow.  But for now, there are signs that sentiment is shifting in Commerce One's  favor.  Gavin Mlinar, an analyst at Sands Brothers, sees three short-term positives  for Commerce One. (He's the analyst who had the gall to downgrade Ariba on  valuation concerns. His firm hasn't done underwriting for either company.)  Mlinar says the word on Wall Street is that Commerce One, along with its new  best friend SAP, will announce two new online exchanges in the coming weeks.  (TSC's Adam Lashinsky recently wrote a column about the partnership between  Commerce One and SAP.) While those sorts of announcements no longer guarantee  a moon shot for a company's stock, they could show that the partnership is  working. Two weeks ago, they announced new exchanges in the mining and energy  industries.  Commerce One declined to comment about the possible exchanges.  Blastoff On top of that, Covisint, the mega-exchange that Commerce One is helping  build for the auto industry, is slated to begin operations at the end of  September, which could give the first indication of whether these exchanges  actually work.  Then there's the coming completion of Commerce One's acquisition of  consulting firm AppNet (APNT:Nasdaq). Investors initially reacted negatively  to that deal. But since then, it's become clear that there aren't enough  consultants in B2B to go around, so the deal will give Commerce One its own  army of geeks to plug in its software.  ""There's no doubt that investors are in a good position with"" either Commerce  One or Ariba, Mlinar says. ""But it's a matter now of who has the near-term  operational catalysts. I think there, it's Commerce One.""  Beyond those short-term catalysts, others say Commerce One has been  positioning itself smartly for the long term, especially with its focus on  the direct business.  ""We think the big play here is in direct,"" says John Biestman, director of  investor relations for Commerce One. ""While we will continue to service the  indirect procurement side, we are hitting at the heart of where we think B2B  will be, which is direct goods. We want to be the best-of-breed player  there.""  Ariba has also made headway there, but its focus has primarily been on the  indirect business, in part because it's easier to get companies to buy things  like paper and pencils online than material that actually goes into the  manufacturing process. But with companies becoming more comfortable about  buying and selling online, they're now looking to the direct business as a  way to save more money. With big customers like GM (GM:NYSE) and Boeing (BA :NYSE) and its partnership with SAP, Commerce One could be ready to exploit  this growing comfort.  Direct vs. Indirect ""What's happening is the marketplace is beginning to understand the  difference between direct and indirect,"" says Ben Smith, a consultant for  A.T. Kearney. (His firm hasn't done consulting for Commerce One.) ""Picking a  [software] solution for one doesn't necessarily include the other.""  Smith points back to Commerce One's partnership with SAP. For years, the  German software maker has been concentrating on the complex kind of software  that helps businesses build things. If a firm can successfully plug that in  to software designed to buy the building blocks -- like Commerce One's  software -- it could have a winning combination.     Of course, Ariba isn't letting this business just slide by. It's working with  partners i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq) and IBM(IBM:Nasdaq).  But this is Commerce One's focus. So if companies do begin to use direct B2B,  Commerce One will be ready and waiting. ",dasovich-j

1502,"I'm adding my two cents.  Here's 3, but not 4.  Few things.    1) I considered that everything was ""material.""  That reasonable?   2) Dylan, I struggled with the ban on preservatives, but ultimately decided  it was unusual, not extraordinary, since the book sez that any write down of  inventory is unusual, as opposed to extra.  But a case for extra can still,  be made I think.    3) I did not include the 1994 litigation expense associated with the ban,  since it seems to me that it's merely an expense that they would have taken  in 1994, as opposed to a ""potential litigation outcome"" that they'd make an  allowance for---I could be wrong, though.    4) Finally, I assumed that the depreciation-related gain was already included  in the 1995 ""income from continuing operations"" number, and consequently  included it as a footnote on my spreadsheet, rather than make it an explicit  line item in the income statement.    I'll look at Kim's #4 and if I have any comments, I'll add them to hers and  circulate.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
1503,"OK.  Having taken a second look at the spreadsheet I sent yesterday, here's a  revised sheet (there was a math error in the original), and my adds to Kim's  #4.  Most significant issue:  the discrepancy between Kim's and mine is that  Kim's assumes that the $9,5 million includes pluses from things like dep/gain  on sale, while mine assumes that it doesn't (i.e., Kim subtracts them, I add  them).

1548,"Internet B2Bs Rose Hard and Fell Hard Once Before. Time for Act Two? By Joe Bousquin  Staff Reporter 8/30/00 9:22 PM ET  URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1060952.html  Beware the booming B2Bs.  Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news  as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day. While some market watchers said  investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain  increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro  (VNTR:Nasdaq), PurchasePro.com (PPRO:Nasdaq) and Clarus (CLRS:Nasdaq).   Big Day for B2B Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.   ""You've got me,"" says Bill Epifanio, B2B analyst at J.P. Morgan. ""They're all  going nuts on nothing.""  Since earnings season ended, sentiment about B2B stocks has shifted back to  the rose-colored variety in this sector. While this change is based on the  concrete results that companies like Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq), i2 Technologies  (ITWO:Nasdaq) and FreeMarkets (FMKT:Nasdaq) delivered, investors also may  want to pause and reflect. After all, it was only this past spring that  investors grabbed any B2B stock within reach on hopes of unlimited growth,  only to have them come crashing back down.  Focus ""Before, we were buying stocks on promises of what they could be, and that's  when it got out of hand,"" says Eric Upin, B2B analyst at Robertson Stephens.  ""Now, you've got to focus on which stocks are delivering lots of growth and  revenue.""  Upin looks to Ariba and i2 Technologies as examples of companies that are  actually delivering. (He rates both a buy, and his firm hasn't done  underwriting for either.)  Ariba recorded $153 million in deferred revenue in the most recent quarter.  Deferred revenue is money that a company collects before it actually delivers  a product or does its job. It's a good signal, because if people are willing  to pay before a company gives them something in return, it means there's  strong demand. Ariba was up $8, or 6%, to $152.50.  i2 is considered a strong player in supply-chain management software, and it  has a partnership with Ariba and IBM (IBM:NYSE). It climbed $11.13, or 7%, to  $168.75.  Reaching? But in a possible indication that investors may have just been reaching for  any B2B stock, Ventro finished up $2.69, or 21%, at $15.50 on no news. This  is the same company that upset analysts and investors with a poor  second-quarter performance, with just $1.8 million in net revenue. ""Investors  need to be more careful regarding which of the B2Bs they select,"" adds David  Hilal, a B2B analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey.    Which is just what some observers are cautioning against. ",dasovich-j

1565,"Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP  regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly  diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.  Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff.   Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day  that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to  be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be  grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of  wisdom.",dasovich-j
1566,"If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the  auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length  relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If  we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely  aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves,  less likely we'll be cut in.    That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable)  conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There  was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of  ""price cap"" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion  whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion  about the benefits of doing a deal on a cap----Williams is dead set against  it, Dynegy & Reliant seemed considerably more pliable.    We reminded folks that there are many other things apart from caps that  California could do to ""fix"" the problem (e.g., site plants, forward  contracts, retail market, core/noncore split, etc.), which might obviate the  need for caps altogether.  We also recognized the political nature of the  situation and expressed a willingness to discuss a cap that might be  acceptable, but pointed out our general concerns with caps.  That last meeting provided the impetus for the 28th press conference, at  which (hopefully) a large number of stakeholders with urge the Governor and  the PUC to get off the dime and do something concrete that can help---develop  a rational policy for forward contracting by the IOUs and abandon the ""PUC as  counterparty"" policy that currently exists.  Again, haven't heard a peep about any deal on refunds.  Will check around,  though.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

Anything to add, Sue? ***************************************************************************= *** *************************************** B. Issues Concerning Implementation of the =01&Soft Cap.=018 =20  IEP has concerns about the implementation of the =01&soft cap=018 proposal.=   IEP=20 has not and does not support price caps because it impedes the operation of= =20 the market and distorts price signals.  Such mechanisms should have no plac= e=20 in competitive markets in the long-run.  The Staff Report notes that caps d= o=20 not work. Citation; Also MSC,   IEP is concerned, as are others, that the= =20 soft cap proposal will fail to attract new investments in supply or foster= =20 meaningful demand response.   It is particularly problematic in terms of=20 attracting new capacity that will operate as peaker units for a limited=20 number of hours when weather-induced demand cannot be met from less expensi= ve=20 units or imports. Notwithstanding the apparent opinion of SMUD otherwise,= =20 there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of= =20 the total hours of a year, and therefore some resources will only be=20 dispatched a short number of hours to meet that need.  These resources tend= =20 to be fast ramping, less efficient units that are not designed or intended = to=20 operate as =01&baseload=018 facilities.  Hence the suggestion that they =01= &just=20 operate more=018 to recover their costs is misplaced. =20 The soft cap also appears to be especially problematic to power marketers w= ho=20 make wholesale purchases for subsequent resale but who may not own the=20 underlying physical generation assets.  These entities have a major role in= =20 the marketplace in terms of bringing demand and supply together and they se= ek=20 return on the risks they undertake.  These entities will perceive the =01&s= oft=20 cap=018 as a =01&hard cap=018 which will chill their participation in Calif= ornia,=20 particularly when regional supplies become tight and expensive.  This=20 unintended consequence must be avoided or the markets will be hobbled. =20 IEP echoes the concern articulated by the CAISO that the soft cap proposal= =20 may divert or require additional ISO resources.    It will clearly compound= =20 the settlement processes at the CAISO as transactions above the soft cap wi= ll=20 require additional tracking and segregation to allow for potential=20 =01&unwinding=018 should the bids be disallowed.  It will also require some=  form of=20 new software to provide for potential calculation of the weighted averaged= =20 prices suggested in the November Order, presumably in 10-minute increments,= =20 to blend with the market clearing prices established in the various markets= . =20 Moreover, if that averaged price associated with bids above the cap is=20 modified often, then CAISO will be required to =01&re-run=018 settlements o= r=20 undertake subsequent settlement adjustments.  It is possible that these=20 efforts=01*which are suggested as temporary measures in the November Order= =01*would=20 take away from CAISO=01,s efforts at developing solutions to longer-run pro= blems=20 in terms of software modifications/development.  At first blush the details= =20 regarding implementation of the soft cap proposal are not straightforward a= s=20 currently described, and any further exploration this approach will at leas= t=20 require a =01&technical conference=018 to clarify the mechanics and to ensu= re that=20 it can be done in a reasonable manner. =20 IEP could only support the soft cap proposal if it is part of a negotiated= =20 package of inter-jurisdictional programs, and provided that it is subject t= o=20 an pre-established unidirectional escalation mechanism, or a similar one-wa= y=20 mechanism that is tied to the development of new capacity within the WSCC. = =20 The inter-jurisdictional elements must include: ? establishment of standards applicable to potential refunds based on=20 allegations of market power abuse in FERC jurisdictional markets;=20 ? definition of durable reasonableness review standards applicable to=20 wholesale purchases by the load serving utilities such that they will no=20 longer be discouraged from entering bilateral arrangements on a forward bas= is; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by the California Commission that del= ineates=20 a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review and resolution of reta= il=20 market issues including market-based demand responsiveness; ? establishment of a =01&road map=018 by this Commission, in consultation w= ith the=20 CAISO, that delineates a firm timeline=01*with milestones=01*for the review=  and=20 resolution of implementation issues associated with the Commission=01,s=20 subsequent order in this docket as well as other outstanding proposals such= =20 as generation interconnection rules and congestion management; ? establishment of firm sunset date, not to exceed 2003, to bound the=20 duration of soft cap, and implement a unidirectional escalation mechanism,= =20 not subject to subsequent lowering, which is based either on a=20 pre-established schedule or tied to increases in installed capacity within= =20 the WSCC.    =09Susan J Mara =09 ",dasovich-j

California's big mistake was replacing one monopoly--the utility---with  another--the PX.  PX's are not necessarily bad things.  But PXs with a  monopoly is a very bad thing. Forcing the IOUS to buy everything from the PX was irresponsible. ""Put everyone on a variable rate mortgage"" story. Decision makers openly admitted that they put in place a strucuture designed  NOT to encourage retail choice and competition. Decision makers actively urged families and businesses NOT to switch to  providers offering an ""insurance policy"" (i.e., fixed price deals) against  the volatile and risky power exchange price. When you combine the supply shortage, the PX monopoly, the nonexistant retail  market and decision makers' attempts to discourage choice, you get a  debacle--that's what California set itself up for, and that's what it got. Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been  inflicted. The real answer is....(we've developed these points already).

1665,"PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.  As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the  past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's  electricity crisis. In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small  customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States  Petroleum Association, and Enron. The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg). When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to  achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in  California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from  the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers). In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the  utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers  would go to market.   The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03. The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close  devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the  utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January  and today remain very contentious). Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR  contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore  structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the  contracts. The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large  customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR  contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost. Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to  address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1)  killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure  focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not  include Direct Access. Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any  ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract  provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the  state are minimal or nonexistent.) In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might  reform the contracts. All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear  that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally  abrogate anyone's contract rights.  We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some  options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the  core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM  PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let  me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.  Thanks, Jeff",dasovich-j

1700,"Davis trying to spin out of energy crisis  Energy advisers have ruthless reputation  Ken Garcia Saturday, June 23, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/06/23/M NN116485.DTL  No matter how much you try to spin the facts, the truth usually topples out.  This will explain why Gray Davis is suffering from a reality blackout,  because no one spins harder or faster than our opaque leader, who, quite  equitably, is suffering his own power crisis.  Why Do You Think They Call Him Gray has an unrelenting black-and-white  problem. How can he explain away his indecision in grappling with the energy  crisis sooner, his inability to hammer out a deal with the utilities and  power suppliers before they had the state handcuffed and his frantic response  to spend $40 million in public funds to purchase future electricity without  offering consumers the details of the pact?  The truth is, he cannot, although he has tried mightily. And to that end he  made one of his biggest mistakes yet -- no small feat when you consider he is  at the center of one of the sharpest economic tailspins in California's  history.  Rather than tackle the issues head-on, Davis did what he has always done: use  consultants and polling data to try and navigate the minefield of public  opinion to put himself in the best possible light and blame others for his  problems. It's a game Bill Clinton perfected but at which the governor is a  mere weekend hobbyist.  Davis' decision to hire two former Clinton-Gore spin doctors to explain away  his role in the energy crisis has been as predictable as this summer's threat  of rolling blackouts. If only, in this case, he could have kept his critics  in the dark.  While the state's taxpayers were hit with record electricity bills, Davis was  pointing his finger at every official in the federal government who might  conceivably have played a role in the crisis and especially those power  suppliers in the Lone Star state who have been soaking California ratepayers  dry.  It is obviously true that the Bush administration has been reluctant to help  the nation's most populous state because it voted for Al Gore in November.  And time will probably show that the power companies in Texas and beyond were  being Snopes-like in their dealings with the Golden State.  But there is no getting around the fact that Davis severely exacerbated  California's energy plight through his own inaction -- as evidenced by our  sweltering soul mates in San Diego who were experiencing blackouts and  spiraling electricity costs early last summer.  Yet why suffer the facts when it's so much easier to just scramble them?  When the energy crisis hit its peak this spring and Davis' popularity ratings  began short-circuiting, he brought in Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, who had  been as ubiquitous in the scandal-ridden Clinton administration as the stain  on a certain intern's dress.  The pair became so adept at parrying the thrusts of truth directed by the  press each day that they earned the label ""masters of disaster"" -- which may  be why Davis thought of them when he considered the calamity beginning to  envelop him. If only he had considered the accompanying stink.  Lehane and Fabiani are considered by the political cognoscenti as nothing  less than ruthless, partisan hired guns, happy to attack anyone standing  between them and a monthly paycheck.  Unfortunately for Davis, the rhetorical hit men's salaries are being paid by  California taxpayers, who are none too happy that they will be socked with  billions of dollars in extra energy charges as a result of Davis' lack of  leadership.  So although Lehane and Fabiani's $30,000 monthly consulting fees may look  paltry to a governor who has contributed to California's lost billions, it  looks quite a bit different to those little people in the bleacher seats,  sometimes known as California's 30 million-plus residents.  The hiring of the disaster duo has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group from  Sacramento that alleges Lehane and Fabiani are violating the state Political  Reform Act because the gunslingers have also worked for Southern California  Edison as consultants -- a generally accepted no-no for public officials,  even those who worked in Washington.  And State Controller Kathleen Connell, a fellow Democrat, has rightfully  refused to pay state funds for the Clinton-Gore castoffs, because she said it  is inconceivable that the two men are working on state policy -- not politics  - - as required by law.  Until obfuscation and misdirection become part of the official state code of  ethics, it's fair to say Connell is on pretty firm ground. Or as one member  of a tax protest group put it: ""We are adding insult to injury to have the  governor who feels the pressure of this crisis to spend this kind of dough  for damage control.""  Damage control is not supposed to incite more damage, but right now Davis is  a metal helmet in an electrical storm. His arrogant treatment of state  voters, his refusal to shoulder responsibility and his efforts to spin his  way out of trouble has left even die-hard Democrats searching for a more  palatable replacement.  That decision will come next year when Davis is up for re-election. And the  millions of people who chose him because he seemed a safe but dull choice  will now realize that there is little solace in gray areas.  Since the governor is involved, it seems apt to call it a cautionary tale.  But by the time the spin doctors are through, it may start to sound more like  an urban legend.

1737,"FYI.  Can we get a copy?  Best, Jeff   Officials criticize energy report  Posted at 8:06 p.m. PDT Thursday, June 28, 2001  BY CHRIS O'BRIEN   Mercury News    California's energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment, reduce  production and aggravate an already weakening economy, according to  researchers at the University of California-Los Angeles.  The impact, however, will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal  with the failed deregulation scheme. The authors of the report released  Thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and  dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the  economic fallout.  ``California's economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather  the current power crisis without being derailed,'' the report says.  ``However, our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an  approach that does not shift today's problems to tomorrow.''  The study, ``Short Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the  State's Economy,'' came under fierce criticism from Gov. Gray Davis' office.  Steven Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said many of the assumptions used to  produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong.  ``It deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust,''  Maviglio said. ``Like any crystal-ball report, it's essentially irrelevant.''  Edward Lamer, a UCLA professor, and Christopher Thornberg, a visiting  professor at UCLA, collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from  the Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  The study concludes that California's gross state product will be cut by  anywhere from .7 percent to 1.5 percent in 2001 as a result of the energy  crisis. In addition, energy problems will increase unemployment by .5 percent  in 2001 and 1.1 percent in 2002. The report predicts consumers can expect 112  hours of rolling blackouts this year.  However, the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if  the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the  wholesale costs. This could reduce blackouts to 12 hours, lower the debt and  interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment  in the state to increase energy supplies.  But Peter Navarro, a management professor at the University of  California-Irvine, was skeptical of the report's findings. He said it was  almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the  factors that affect energy prices in the state.  In addition, he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation  of the current market, which Navarro argues could be distorting prices as  well.  ``How do you justify raising retail rates to 45 cents for power that costs a  nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed?''  Navarro said. ``This report seems to have an industry point of view and an  industry agenda.'' ",dasovich-j

1751,"Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and  apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and  Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a  comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore).   In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides  more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly  challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much  more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on.   That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the  plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of  August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough  time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in  time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant  energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides  refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.   This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and  now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.  Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting  the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as  soon as I have more information on that.

1767,"Greetings:  Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.  I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.   The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to  include some of the Hertzberg language, too.  I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond  bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:  Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.  17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt  from paying for the bonds.   In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from  their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services  from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it  wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.  Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but  subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by  DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.    For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying  power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only  be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from  Jan. 17th thru April 30th.  I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took  place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the  talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree  pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create  unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include  very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what  customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.  In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with  incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it  finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to  switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short  position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby  reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity  purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.  With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to  the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches  to Direct Access by September 1st.  Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct  Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that  seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if  that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?  Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and  passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

1788,"   California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub  Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray  Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity  market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a  misdirected e-mail.  The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was  intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve  Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press  list, he said.  Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would  compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a  state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and  confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is  buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt.  ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a  meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail  contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of  electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough  electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged  from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the  e-mail is accurate.  Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a  megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to  Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot  market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher  than on the day-ahead market.  The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a  quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each  season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law  requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.",dasovich-j

Best, Jeff ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Campaign funds will pay for spots  Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, July 7, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will begin a series of radio ads next week  defending his handling of the energy crisis -- further proof that political  campaigning has become a permanent sport.  Davis political adviser Garry South said the ads are designed to fill an  ""information void"" among Californians about what the state has accomplished.  But they are playing statewide just as millions of dollars of TV ads financed  by Republicans and power companies are attacking Davis.  ""The campaign season has started early,"" said Rob Stutzman, a consultant with  the state GOP, which has not been involved with the anti-Davis TV spots  running since June 19.  Davis' 60-second radio spot takes the form of an ""energy update,"" where the  governor informs listeners that ""we"" have licensed 16 new power plants,  including three Davis opened this month, and that ""conservation is the best  way to fight back against high energy prices.""  Davis' ads convey the same information as a series of state-financed ""Flex  Your Power"" ads run by the Department of Consumer Affairs, only those ads  don't mention Davis. Davis' campaign fund, worth well above $25 million, is  paying for the $150,000-per-week radio spots to avoid accusations he is using  state money to finance his political ambitions.  South dismissed the notion that the radio ads came in response to the TV ads  that make Davis a target, saying the governor's poll numbers are actually  going up. He said people laughed at the ads attacking the governor as  ridiculous, particularly one showing Davis in Red Square.  ""One of the reasons we chose this ('energy update') tack,"" South said, ""is  that people simply are not in the mood to have some full-out firefight and  some partisan battle about this problem. They are in a just-the-facts-ma'am  mood.""  Stutzman said he didn't disagree with South about the ill-timed and partisan  nature of the TV ads, which are financed out of Washington, D.C., but he said  the governor is also launching a political firefight of his own.  ""These ads, even though the the first iteration of them sound like public  service ads, very much are political ads,"" Stutzman said. ""The reason they  may be poor political ads is they use the governor's voice, and I don't think  he has any credibility on this issue.""  Davis already has updated his 2002 campaign Web site, www.gray-davis.com,  which includes an odd-looking caricature of the governor and a photo of Davis  standing with actor Martin Sheen, who plays a president on the TV show ""The  West Wing."" The Sheen photo dominates the home page.  ""What we're trying to do with the Web site is have a little fun with it,""  said South, who declined to say whether Davis would run against President  Bush in 2004.  Last month, a conservative group with links to Republicans and energy  companies began running a series of ads blaming Davis for the energy crisis  and saying the state was suffering from ""Grayouts.""  Time magazine reported last month that hundreds of corporations had  contributed to the ads attacking Davis, who has accused Texas firms such as  Reliant Energy of ""unconscionable price-gouging.""  Reliant, which donated $10,000 to Davis before the energy crisis, has  contributed to the anti-Davis advertising effort, according to Time, and the  American Taxpayers Alliance hopes to raise as much as $25 million to keep the  ads running in California through July.  Scott Reed, a former campaign manager for Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential  bid, formed the American Taxpayers Alliance in Washington to raise money for  the 30-second ads. He has refused to name his donors, and did not return a  call for comment yesterday.  Even though the 2002 elections are more than a year away, Republicans are  worried they are losing ground in Congress on Bush's energy policy, and  Davis' popularity has slipped somewhat in the polls.  But the ads mounted by both sides also are designed to change public policy.  Davis recently hired former Clinton-Gore campaign and White House strategists  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani, and Davis' public presence and political pull  dramatically increased.  Another conservative group, the 21st Century Energy Project, will begin  running TV ads next week in Washington to promote expansion of the energy  supply, more drilling and nuclear energy.  The $500,000, two-week advertising purchase is being coordinated by Ed  Gillespie, a former campaign strategist for Bush and a consultant for  Houston's Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader.  Gillespie said yesterday his group wants to promote a ""conservative, market-  oriented message"" about energy, to counteract environmental groups such as  the Sierra Club. He said environmentalists aren't addressing the gap between  supply and demand, except through strict conservation.  ""We're trying to shape the debate, because it's been pretty one-sided so  far,"" Gillespie said.  E-mail Robert Salladay at  ",dasovich-j

The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the  individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments  provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new  draft by noon tomorrow (PDT). The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB  tomorrow (Monday). As expected, some in the group are attempting to ""recontract"" certain  portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin. The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal. Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee  to produce a bill to deliver to Davis. In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service  the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link  the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought  initially. Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation  stand.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

1818,"Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn  By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  September 1, 2000  Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive  -- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do  nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills.  The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what  most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers  ultimately face the daunting task of paying them.  No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power  market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And  while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less  now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest --  beginning in 2003.  ""The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there,"" said  Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking  relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity  customers.  The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have  SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or  70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May.  Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have;  presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E  customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that  level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs  for each customer in so-called balancing accounts.  A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state  money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will  almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due  in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the  construction of power plants.  So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it  obligates them to pay the balance with interest later.  The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The  higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing  accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts  come due.  Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy  estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude,  said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a  year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills.  Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about  $55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power  prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under  the Davis proposal.  ""The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting  profits,"" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based  consumer group.  Hoge said the bills that emerged ""seemed the best a corrupt system could spit  out."" She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to  pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric  generating companies and wholesale power markets.  FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies  are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of  the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants.  Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis  bill, although he said it won't fix ""the almost irreparably broken California  energy system.""  ""The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected  to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market,"" Shames said. ""It's a  market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies.""  But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against  further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will  ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills.  But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and  Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes  the rate-cap legislation.  ""This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs,"" said Court,  who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared  to last year.  Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E --  a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between  what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from  customers over the next three years.  The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will  challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them.  ""The problem is with the wholesale markets,"" said Baum, who today becomes  chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. ""This legislation does nothing  but postpone a big bill.""  He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be  illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission.  ""If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed  and can't stand,"" Baum said.",dasovich-j

1821,"Folks: Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put  mine in strike-out-underline.  They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions  regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I  think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as  ""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it  is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't  show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve,  like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost  recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which  obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the  outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever  reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases,  the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer  must choose Term or Direct Access Service.  Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the  ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm  happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the  document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe  that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.  In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e.,  ""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the  language, but I took a shot nonetheless.  Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this  document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or  anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot,  do that at this time.  Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in  hearing me out earlier).  Best, Jeff  ",dasovich-j

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with  either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't  object, to extending it to 90 days.

The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to  go along.  The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this  point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the  core/noncore proposal.

Granted,  we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with  Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be  helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review  the Hogan piece.    Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn  ""analysis""  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be  very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power  included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't  nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to  exploring it.  Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals  folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to  include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull  Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.

Best, Jeff ************************************************************************* Power purchase bills exceed $7.5 billion  Published Tuesday, July 10, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News  BY MARK GLADSTONE, NOAM LEVEY AND DION NISSENBAUM   Mercury News Sacramento Bureau    SACRAMENTO -- Six months after jumping into the electricity business, the  Davis administration on Monday provided the first detailed glimpse of  California's daily power purchases, showing more than $5 billion in payments,  much of it to government-owned utilities and private companies that state  officials have branded as price gougers.  The state spent an additional $2.5 billion on a variety of contracts and  other electricity services designed to stabilize the volatile energy markets,  according to documents that the state agreed to release last week amid a  legal dispute over public access to the data.  In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2  billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for  electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro  in British Columbia. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power.  The documents raise questions about some of the common assumptions that have  arisen around the electricity crisis. For instance, almost 40 percent of the  state's purchases have come from government-run power generators in  California and elsewhere, but not Texas; some of the biggest suppliers are  from the Northwest.  Gov. Gray Davis, who has ambitions to run for the White House, has put much  of the blame for the soaring costs of power on energy companies based in  President Bush's home state.  The figures are tucked inside 1,770 of pages of invoices that Davis has  resisted divulging, saying disclosure would encourage suppliers to charge  more. The state, which last month released information on its long-term  electricity contracts worth $43 billion, agreed Thursday to release the first  quarter details.  Short on explanation  The figures were disclosed late Monday by the California Department of Water  Resources, which buys power for the state's financially strapped major  utilities, and seem to buttress the administration's contention that the  price of power is gradually dropping but offer little or no explanation for  what prompted the decrease.  In January, for instance, the average price for power on the spot market was  $321 a megawatt hour. It peaked in April at $332 and dropped to $271 in May.  One megawatt powers about 750 homes.  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the price data supports the governor's  assertions that California has been gouged. ``The bad guys are clearly the  out-of-state generators,'' Maviglio said. ``There has been a significant  shift of money out of California.''  But the documents fail to shed much light on whether, as the administration  contends, the price drop was due to long-term power contracts negotiated by  the state earlier this year. Critics contend that the Davis administration  panicked and rushed into deals that commit the state to pay high prices for  many years.  Used for support  Republican officials used the price information to bolster their attacks  against Davis, a Democrat, for signing long-term contracts with power  generators even as the price of power on the spot market was coming down,  partly because of the declining price of natural gas used to fuel many  plants.  ``It's more clear than ever that the long-term contracts are a bad deal,''  said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo. ``The governor's really hurt  the ratepayers for the next five or 10 years.''  The newly released bills highlight the volatility of California's energy  market, where the price per megawatt hour ranged from $70 to $1,000. On any  given day, the records show, the prices from seller to seller varied widely,  with some of the highest prices being charged by public utilities and  companies outside Texas.  On one day in February, for example, San Diego-based Sempra Energy was  charging $165 per megawatt hour, the Eugene Water and Electric Board was  charging nearly $500 and Duke Energy, a North Carolina company, was charging  up to $575.  The state's daily spending peaked May 10 at $102.4 million for all power,  including the spot market and contracted power.  The state began buying power in mid-January on behalf of the state's major  utilities, which were unable to borrow money to buy power after amassing  enormous debts for electricity.  San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which is building several new power plants  around California including one in South San Jose, did only $29 million worth  of business with the state in the first five months of the year, according to  the figures.  The state began buying power in mid-January when Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  and Southern California Edison Co. were on the ropes financially. PG&E later  went into bankruptcy.  On Monday, state lawmakers took another shot at trying to cobble together a  plan to rescue financially ailing Edison.  While most concede that a rescue plan Davis worked out with Edison will not  win the necessary support in the Legislature, lawmakers have created several  working groups to come up with alternatives.  Compromise plan  On Monday, state Sen. Byron Sher, D-Redwood City, unveiled the latest  compromise proposal that seeks to protect average ratepayers and small  businesses from further rate increases and forces everyone else to help  finance the Edison bailout.  The ``shared pain'' proposal would force power producers, owed about $1  billion, to take a 30 percent ``haircut'' and agree to forgive about $300  million in Edison debts. Edison would be asked to swallow $1.2 billion --  about a third of its debt. And big users would be asked to pay off the  remaining $2 billion in debts, possibly by paying higher prices for power.  In exchange, large companies would be given the opportunity to buy power on  the open market, a system that would allow many of them to sign cheap energy  deals.  Sher presented the proposal to Senate Democrats Monday afternoon, but it  remains unclear how much support the framework will receive in the  Legislature.    Contact Mark Gladstone at  ",dasovich-j

1891,"Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues   (Published July 11, 2001)  California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit:  The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it  can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of  dollars to cover the debt.  There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat  truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners  demand more juice than California can generate or buy.  One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy  protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of  joining it.  There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin,  media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming  dominant, while the real situation fades into the background.  This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality  and everything to do with the virtual version.  Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the  generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past  year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, ""being gouged and ripped  off."" But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an  arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended  for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic,  Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity.  ""There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a  billion dollars,"" Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But  that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. ""If you  think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see  you in court,"" Davis said Tuesday.  Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since he  began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off  California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for  substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple  of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be  embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as  fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators.  That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event  this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year  -- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do  it.  Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power  brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on  Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan  George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which  were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that  less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to  Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such  publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that  undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from  continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic  virtual world.  One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a  pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for  Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from  slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the  Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's  debts would be slimmed down by FERC.  This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will  stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the  utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty  old reality that cannot simply be wished away.   The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or  ",dasovich-j

1924,"Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he  sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key  points: Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site  plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.  The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm  requirement. The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or  2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting  down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two  LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting). In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO  (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of  going to the market, thus killing the economics. On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it  be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has  contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and  maintain the plant,""  it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is  (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal  resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks  prefer).  In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while  the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in  bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.  If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the  ""general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap"" bills, and faxed the siting bill.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small  customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal  that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.  Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the  MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.   The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not  yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting  attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is  attached) are:  Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on  the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book. Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by  customers 20KW and above. Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the  generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits,  investigations, etc.) The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts  and what the payment structure will look like.  Reaction and Timetable Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the  bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong  possibility. Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed Republicans are strongly opposed Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX  labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to  include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate  has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access. Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds  to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts.  AB82XX does not address this issue. Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a ""modified MOU.""   Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their ""modified""  MOU this weekend or early next week. The Assembly will hold an ""informational"" hearing on the bill tomorrow  (Saturday) to get members up to speed The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday,  with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on  Tuesday.

1937,"California Power-Price Boost Not Needed, Agency Says (Update1) By Daniel Taub   Sacramento, California, July 13 (Bloomberg) -- California regulators won't  need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned $13.4  billion bond sale, said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf  of the state's utilities.   The California Department of Water Resources, which has spent more than $7.7  billion on power this year, is expected to recommend a rate increase of as  much as 25 percent, Dow Jones reported today, citing three unnamed members of  the state's Public Utilities Commission. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the  agency, said no rate increase is expected.   ``Our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what  our numbers show,'' Hidalgo said. ``In fact our numbers show that there is no  need for any increase beyond what's already been done.''   The Department of Water Resources will submit a report to the California  Public Utilities Commission today or Monday with the state's revenue  requirements for repaying a planned $13.4 billion bond sale, Hidalgo said.  The bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by PG&E Corp.,  Edison International and Sempra Energy.   The bond sales, the largest municipal offering in U.S. history, are scheduled  to begin in September. Governor Gray Davis has said repeatedly that he  believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases. His position  hasn't changed, spokesman Steve Maviglio said today.   Previous Increases   In March, the PUC voted to boost rates by 3 cents a kilowatt- hour at the  state's two largest utilities. Rates at PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric, the  largest California utility, would rise by as much as 36 percent and Southern  California Edison rates would rise by as much as 27 percent, the PUC said at  the time.   The average consumer-price increase would be 30 percent, the PUC said. The  increase, the second this year, was intended to help the state pay for power  purchases. The PUC voted in January to raise rates about 10 percent.   California Treasurer Philip Angelides has said that the bonds will let the  state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by  spreading power costs over time. The debt will be repaid over 15 years.   Investors have said they can't predict how the bonds will be received without  knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt.   Legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise  electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment. That pledge, typical for  revenue bonds, usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money  annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an  added cushion.   That formula, known as a debt service coverage ratio, must result in  investment-grade ratings for California's power bonds, according to the  legislation. Investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to  maintain the promised cushion, even if increases aren't needed at the time of  the bond sale. ",dasovich-j

1939,"Here's the latest that we have on the legislation (""82XX"") released on Friday. The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an ""informational"" hearing on 82XX at  1:30 PM PDT today. ""Informational"" means that there won't be a vote today. Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman  Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an ""author""  of 82XX),  Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant. The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution. Dutra is unhappy with the process thus far----claimed he wasn't familiar with  the ""more recent version"" of the bill, and was unhappy that there would be a  hearing today---informational or otherwise--before he and the bill's other  authors had agreed to final language from their perspective. Dutra said that he was working to remove the Direct Access suspension and  asked the biz groups to hold their fire until the amendments come out  tomorrow. PUC President Lynch continues to oppose striking a deal in which the  Commission gives up all review of DWR's ""revenue requirement"" and simply  flows all DWR costs through rates (but Davis and his administration are  putting her under enormous pressure to buckle under and agree). As a result, details of any ""rate agreement"" between DWR and the CPUC, and  any public announcement by DWR of its ""revenue requirement"" is could be  postponed until next week, unless there's a breakthrough with Loretta. The Governor's consultants now claim (and will reportedly testify at the  hearing today) that there is enough room in the 3 cent rate increase to cover  both Edison's and DWR's revenue requirements.  (They cite lower gas prices  and FERC's price cap as the driving force for the newly-found headroom,  though many remain very skeptical.) However, if the deal is applied to PG&E, it is unlikely that the 3 cent rate  would be sufficient, according to the same consultants. The plan (at this point) is to have the bill--with amendments--discussed in  the same committee tomorrow, and voted out of the committee.  The bill would  then be taken to the full Assembly for an up or down vote on Wednesday. It is unclear whether, at this point, there is agreement among Assembly  Democrats to vote the bill out of the full Assembly on Wednesday. In addition, Senate Democrats continues to work on their own version  of an  Edison ""MOU,"" and the working relationship between the Assembly side and the  Senate side appears strained. The Republicans in the Assembly are staunchly opposed to 82XX and are  generally being ignored by the Democrats, since the Democrats need no  Republicans to get a majority vote to pass bills.

This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall  that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and  Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).    Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been  scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would ""impair"" the  contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western  Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.  As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the  2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.

Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or  opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric  mayhem. There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates  from building into the state. If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing  its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take)  capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing  pipe into the state?  Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.

1967,"What people know:  Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today  and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again  tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a  chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose  unless significantly amended. The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an ""informational""  hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be  heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to  support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the  best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't  available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute  then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however,  since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the  Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any  agreement in his bill (82XX). The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most  believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail. The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It  will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it  kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for  that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill. Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General  Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the  next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting  it behind the scenes).  What people don't know: Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by  Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his  signature.  Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the  Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not  postpone). Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature  will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to  postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on  the energy legislation at the same time.  Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not  get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.  Best, Jeff  Sacramento is one goofy place.

To wit:  according to the ISO's own calculations, Enron represents  FOUR TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT--that's four-tenths of one percent---of the  alleged ""overcharges.""  John, combined, the government sellers, including CA  munis have, by the ISOs own calculations, ""overcharged"" California by a  factor of ONE HUNDRED times what Enron has alleged to have ""overcharged.""

I'm looking forward to Mr. Marcus and  others directing their invective at SMUD, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank and  LADWP.

The $6.1 billion estimate merely establishes ""a=20 potential framework for settlement discussions,"" Eric Hildebrandt, the ISO'= s=20 chief analyst on the matter, told the FERC.=20  FERC administrative law judge Curtis Wagner, who has dismissed the $8.9=20 billion figure as baseless and criticized California's delegation for not= =20 negotiating in good faith, estimated in his report on the talks that refund= s=20 due may amount to about $1 billion. Power suppliers offered just over $700= =20 million.=20  Wagner has recommended FERC hold a 60-day hearing to set the level of refun= ds=20 and has told the ISO to revise its estimate of what California is owed.=20  The ISO's original $8.9 billion figure included electricity sales to=20 municipal utilities and alternative energy suppliers that didn't go through= =20 the ISO's wholesale markets, the California Power Exchange or the Californi= a=20 Department of Water Resources. Without direct knowledge of the prices of=20 those purchases, the ISO made estimates.=20  ""We know the volume (of the bilateral deals),"" Hildebrandt said. ""The refun= d=20 amount was based on extrapolation of observed prices in the spot market.""= =20   Resetting The Baseline=20   Wagner told the ISO to recalculate its figure using only sales through the= =20 ISO and CalPX markets - which were set up by the state's deregulation law f= or=20 California's three investor-owned utilities to purchase power - in addition= =20 to sales to the California Department of Water Resources.=20  The DWR has been buying power for the utilities since PG&E Corp.

DWR has= =20 also been covering the needs of Sempra Energy (SRE, news, msgs) unit San=20 Diego Gas & Electric Co.=20  In arriving at his new estimate, the ISO's Hildebrandt also recalculated fa= ir=20 prices - the baseline against which refundable amounts are determined - by= =20 retroactively applying the price controls FERC imposed June 19.

For example, FERC's price limits are now based on a monthly averag= e=20 of natural gas prices covering supplies throughout the state. Wagner=20 recommended using power producers' actual gas costs. Since gas is=20 considerably more expensive in southern California, using actual prices wou= ld=20 cut potential refunds sharply.=20  Also, Wagner said that refunds should be ordered on sales only as far back = as=20 Oct. 2, which would reduce the total amount claimed by California by about= =20 one-third, according to Hildebrandt's previous monthly breakdown.=20  ISO staff is again recalculating the refund estimate to reflect some of=20 Wagner's recommendations, but the ISO will still include sales back to May= =20 2000, said spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle.=20  ""The reason we're not going back just to Oct. 2 is that all of the=20 overcharges going back to May should be repaid,"" McCorkle said. ""We just=20 maintain that position.""=20   FERC Baseline Questioned=20   In addition, Hildebrandt argues in his recently released estimate that when= =20 fair prices are calculated retroactively using FERC's new formula, the pric= e=20 cap should be based on the least efficient generator the ISO knows to have= =20 been available, not the least efficient generator actually used to meet=20 demand.=20  That's because the FERC's new price controls require all available generato= rs=20 be made available to the ISO at any time, Hildebrandt said.=20  Applying that rule would raise the ISO's revised estimate substantially: to= =20 $7.7 billion from $6.1 billion.=20  One of the ways generators managed to manipulate prices higher, Hildebrandt= =20 said, was to not offer cheaper power from more efficient units.

1987,"The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very  difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's  going to be left dangling.  In the Senate: The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of  the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee. Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is  it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the  committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt. The key features of the bill are: Banks and QFs get paid in full. Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers No direct access. There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill  tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the  Republicans will go along with it.  In the Assembly: The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with  Hertzberg's the likely winner. That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the  amendments describing the conditions were faxed today). We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of  the bill"" or later. The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the  earliest.  The Problem: The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each  approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the  night. The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and  Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.  The likely outcome given the circumstances:   Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill);  the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out;  they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.  That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit  down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin  talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.

In the Senate: SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees  yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.   The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget  from payment of DWR contracts. The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of  the DWR contracts. The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or  end, Direct Access. Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the  Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill  would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to  substantial damages. As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly,  its chances of passage there are low. SB72XX---The Senate's MOU The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee  yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of  passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50. The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting  for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other  democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and  leadership is awesome.  In the Assembly: The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX) The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue. The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his  own bill (82XX). Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat  (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly  Republicans. In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail. Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very  difficult time getting a budget passed. As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is  trying to cobble together an alternative to 18. ",dasovich-j

2016,"Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy  Former governor defends himself  Carla Marinucci, Chronicle Political Writer Friday, July 20, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/20/MN187903.DTL  Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy  deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for  failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency  powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis.  ""There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis  on everyone else,"" the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics  and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday.  Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and ""put in  jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs,"" Wilson said the Democratic  governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to  blur perception of the current energy troubles.  ""They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And  they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush,""  said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as ""a  triumph -- for Davis.""  But Davis' strategy, he said, ""doesn't create one watt of new power.""  Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis  -- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank,  released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as  the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not  Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows.  The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political  adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to ""revise history.""  ""If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised  one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it,"" South said yesterday.     Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the  California Energy Commission about coming blackouts.  And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and  skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a  crisis: emergency powers.  Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested  it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used  his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the  bridges within 65 days.  South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the  energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full-  blown statewide energy crisis.

2024,"Senate approves Edison rescue deal, Assembly measure stalled By Jennifer Coleman  Associated Press Writer  SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state Senate approved a bill that significantly alters  the plan negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis to help the struggling utility  Southern California Edison.  The bill approved Friday, authored by Democratic Sens. Richard Polanco and  Byron Sher, lets Edison issue $2.5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts  amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record-high levels in  the last year.  ""I believe it's a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out  of the business of buying electricity ... and to bring this entity to  creditworthiness,"" said Polanco, D-Los Angeles.  Approved 22-17, the bill now goes to the Assembly. The Assembly adjourned  Friday night without voting on a similar measure.  The Polanco-Sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial  and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by  Edison, which says it won't help the company escape bankruptcy.  Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its  transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its  estimated $3.5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay  skyrocketing wholesale power prices.  Under the plan by Polanco, and Sher, of Stanford, the state has a five-year  option to buy Edison's grid.  That, said Republican Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine, gives Edison a bailout it  ""neither needs nor deserves.  ""I am tired of this projection of Edison as a victim. They have their legion  of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn't support  deregulation,"" Johnson said during floor debate. ""The idea of Edison as the  victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers. Edison paid their lobbyists  bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation.""  During the 1995-1996 deliberations that led to deregulation, Edison officials  helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and  then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican.  Lawmakers are set to go on summer break Friday night until Aug. 20, a  schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the Memorandum of Understanding  between Davis and Edison. That says the Legislature must approve the deal by  Aug. 15.  ""It's a firm deadline, which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior  to the end of the legislative recess,"" Davis said Friday.  For that to happen, either the Senate bill or a proposal by Assembly Speaker  Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek,  has to reach Davis.  ""I have problems with both bills,"" Davis said. ""I am heartened by the fact  that there's a bill moving in each house.""  The Keeley-Hertzberg plan trims at least $300 million from the governor's  offer. It also allows Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by  Edison ratepayers over 10 years.  The plan also attempts to increase the state's use of ""green"" energy  resources and allow Edison customers to opt for cheaper direct-access energy  service.  The Assembly didn't vote on the Keeley bill Friday, because Hertzberg is  considering forming a working group with the Senate and the administration to  ""iron out the bills' differences,"" said Hertzberg's spokesman Paul Hefner.  Davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer  break to devise a compromise by the Aug. 15 deadline.  ""I don't want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry  about it on Aug. 20 because I know we're going to have reapportionment and  other major issues to deal with in that last month,"" the governor said.

2028,"Summary of the activities since Friday:  Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget  and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an ""Edison  MOU."" Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and  passed through both houses by COB Monday.    In the Senate: The   Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the  full Senate for a vote on Saturday. In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican  party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the  date of the vote with Burton and Dunn. She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not  to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August  20th. If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the  likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.  The budget: The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning. The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return  until August 20th. That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the  budget and the Edison MOU.  The Assembly In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much  influence over its own party--the Democrats.   The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue. Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not  reconvened.  It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget. The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says  it intends to do. Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go  back into session until Tuesday morning. Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his  Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough  votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it. Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released  on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

2036,"NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE  Looks Like a Recession  Economy on the edge  Michael J. Boskin Sunday, July 22, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/22/I N144927.DTL  California, the world's fifth largest economy, the global capital of  technology and entertainment, is teetering on the brink of a serious  recession.  Unemployment is rising, job creation is falling and respected forecasters are  painting a bleak future for the state.  California is not alone. Nationally, the employment picture is also  troubling. Income is flat. Industrial production has been shrinking for nine  months. Only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going.  The key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending, so  important for California. Once the engine of productivity growth, and the  source of rising standards of living, the double-digit pace of those spending  increases slowed dramatically, beginning in the second half of last year.  Since then, Silicon Valley companies have experienced sales declines of 5 to  10 percent, not calamitous drops, but compared to the 40 percent growth they  had been used to, an enormous gap. Hence these companies have been cutting  back on everything from production to personnel to facilities. The ""new  economy,"" it turns out, is not immune to the basic laws of economics.  Nationally, the most respected ""blue chip"" private forecasters believe we  will avoid a recession. They see the economy growing just over 1 percent this  year and by 2 to 3 percent next year.  Having been more optimistic for some years, I became more pessimistic last  year, and remain so despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and the  Bush administration's tax refunds. Whether we skirt the technical definition  of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- will be a  close call. We should see a modest recovery late this year, and a pick-up of  steam in 2002.  The California economy is in for a rougher time, at least in the short term.  And this time -- unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California bore the  brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry -- the Bay Area will be  hit much harder. While the region grew much faster than the rest of the state  in the '90s, most of the symbols of that growth -- full employment, exploding  property values, shrinking commercial vacancy rates -- are already history.  Workers who just a short time ago were getting BMWs as a signing bonus are  now being laid off.  Statewide unemployment -- 5.1 percent last month -- is likely to increase  another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and  aerospace. Still -- and here's some good news -- Bay Area unemployment, even  in Santa Clara County, which took a major hit in June, is still below the  statewide rate. In per capita income, the San Francisco and San Jose  metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide, 75 percent above  the national average.  What of the longer term? California faces serious problems, not the least of  which is the energy mess, which has exacerbated the current slowdown. Our  recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country.  But the long-term picture is brighter. Information technologies have brought  about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every  major industry in the so-called ""old economy."" Such enhancements will  themselves result in renewed information technology spending, if not at the  frenetic pace of the late 1990s.  The main concern is whether California will degenerate into an even more  anti-business climate. We are already viewed by the business community as an  overtaxed, over-regulated state. Gov. Gray Davis' rhetoric, and some of his  actions, during the energy debacle have only added to the impression. While  Davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy  conservation, his demagogic attacks on ""outside"" energy companies, and the  suggestion that California should go it alone, are not only poor policy  solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part.  His plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and  transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars. Do we  believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely,  efficiently and devoid of politics? California would be better off if the  governor got out of the energy business.  The state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the  energy situation. The initial refusal by Davis' appointees on the Public  Utilities Commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened  the shortages and sharpened the price spikes. Then, at the peak of the market  frenzy, the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the  state into paying unnecessarily high prices. And by keeping prices to  consumers unrealistically controlled, he has passed the burden for energy  costs on to the taxpayers -- current and future.  With all the problems and missteps, however, there is great reason to be  optimistic about California's economic future. We are still a beacon of  opportunity. We still attract the best and the brightest. We are still the  best incubator of new ideas and businesses.  However, our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for  granted. With better state policy -- lower tax rates, less regulation,  reforms to improve our schools, and a more efficient energy and  transportation infrastructure -- California will reemerge as the leader of a  strong national economy, providing opportunity, mobility and still higher  standards of living.

Best, Jeff Figures show state lost big on extra power  Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001  BY JOHN WOOLFOLK  Mercury News  State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month  selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.  The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a  loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much  excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts --  and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be  needed.  A Republican lawmaker said Monday the loss also shows Democratic Gov. Gray  Davis' energy policies are needlessly costing consumers.  ``This whole thing is a mess,'' said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, who  requested details of the state's surplus power sales. ``The government needs  to get out of the power business before it costs Californians even more  money.''  A state spokesman didn't dispute the $14 million figure outright but said it  is an approximation based on average prices and that the actual loss probably  is less.  ``It's a number I'm sure he likes very much, but it's definitely an estimated  number, and it could be far lower,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the  state Department of Water Resources.  Campbell responded that the loss also could be higher.  The state has spent $415 million on power so far this month.  State officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer  conservation have left California holding more power than it needs. The  revelation was a stunning turnaround for a state that months ago was paying  top dollar for power, expecting shortages this summer.  Price that was paid  The state bought 3.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity for July at an  average price of $118 per megawatt-hour, according to a response Friday by  the Department of Water Resources to Campbell's inquiry. The state has sold  178,000 surplus megawatt-hours in July at an average price of $37, the  department said.  Based on those average prices, the state paid $21 million for the surplus  power, which it sold for $6.5 million -- $14.5 million less than it cost.  A more precise calculation of the state's loss is difficult because purchased  power is acquired at different times and prices and pooled as a  ``portfolio.''  Purchases included long-term contracts that averaged $138 per megawatt-hour  as well as cheaper spot-market buys.  State officials last week said they were selling surplus at $15 to $30 a  megawatt-hour, while some traders cited unconfirmed sales as low as $1.  Hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just 5 percent of California's  July purchases, which totaled $415 million. The $6.5 million from sales will  help lower the state's power bill, he said, adding that utilities routinely  sell some extra electricity.  ``Despite the fact that we're in somewhat of a surplus, any power-buying  operation in the world is going to have to plan for these types of  situations,'' Hidalgo said. ``It's not unique, and in fact it's normal  operating procedure for any utility.''  Other Western utilities, including Portland General Electric in Oregon, have  said they, too, are selling some surplus power at a loss and describe it as a  cost of doing business.  The suppliers buying the state's surplus electricity on the cheap include the  big out-of-state energy companies that the governor has called price-gouging  ``snakes.'' Among them are Duke Energy, Dynegy Power and Marketing, El Paso  Power Services, Mirant, Reliant Energy and Williams Energy.  `Best bid' taken  Hidalgo said the state took the best offers it could find.  ``It's only reasonable to get the best bid you can,'' he said.  Campbell said the $14 million loss is troubling because ratepayers or  taxpayers will have to cover the cost, whereas a private utility could be  forced to eat the expense if regulators determined it was unreasonable.  State officials say what's more important is that the overall cost of power  is dropping, from an average daily tab of $64 million in May to $25 million  this month, in part because the state has so much power.

2063,"Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for  years (Published July 24, 2001)  The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more  intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee  sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn  over internal documents.  Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.  At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted  criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. ""I would love  to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a  tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said. With  less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based  companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor  suppliers to California.  Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that  Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of  President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the  rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are  interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also  filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading  data.  Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating  Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality  agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph  Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a  report asking the Senate for ""an appropriate coercive sanction.""  Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's  happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears  about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would  data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data  be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands  of class-action attorneys?  Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will  be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative  purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of  turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was  leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state  Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that  private lawyers are working closely with investigators.  Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a ""smoking gun"" to prove  collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few  dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,  that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create  artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted  the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent  System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that  ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.  Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now  under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents  that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.  Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.  Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that ""we need your help  in properly getting this information out."" But Aguirre, in an interview, said  he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.  The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes  will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at  least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their  utility bill checks.

2071,"Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly  members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make  a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.   Some key considerations:  The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something  done. The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having ""done  nothing."" Becauase the Assembly has thus far ""done nothing,"" the only thing it has in  front of it is 78. The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill  was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a  reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order  to get the support necessary to get voted out. Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where  the Senate would have to approve it. Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and  call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that  Burton's inclined to come back. In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes  to 78, that ""it's 78 or nothing.""  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e.,  Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's  amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye  on the issues. All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be  counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could  move.  Will report back as information becomes available. Best, Jeff    	  < ",dasovich-j

2077,"Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured  with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version  of an  :  The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet  that the Assembly would not convene on Friday. He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until  they get back from recess on the 20th of August. The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether  they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess. From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it  appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.  The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be  pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small  customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing). Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's  transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider  buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but  place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to  suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.) Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to  the one created in Texas). The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill  passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new  version of 82XX.  The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest  proposal. If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult  time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has  considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly  version. Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for  recess as soon as we hear.  Best, Jeff ----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on  ",dasovich-j

2151,"FYI.  This is THE story out here today.  Given the repugnant things that  Maviglio has said about Enron over the past several months, it will be very  interesting to see whether he'll be able to withstand the fact that all the  time that he was saying those things, he owned our stock.  Gee, couldn't  happen to a nicer guy.  Best, Jeff  In addition, all this buzz about conflicts with traders and Calpine could put  in jeopardy the state's contracts with Calpine, which may, in the end, be a  very good thing for Direct Access. Davis spokesman under fire for stock  By Amy Chance and Dale Kasler Bee Staff Writers (Published July 31, 2001)  Davis administration spokesman Steve Maviglio acknowledged Monday that he  bought stock in Calpine Corp. in June, at a time when the company was  announcing a breakthrough in its bid to build a controversial San Jose power  plant.  His disclosure came several days after Gov. Gray Davis dismissed five state  power purchasers for owning stock in the company and drew new complaints that  Davis administration officials may have improperly mixed their private  finances and their public roles.  Maviglio, now acting as interim communications director for the  administration, said he put in an ""open"" order for Calpine stock May 31,  agreeing to buy 300 shares once the stock hit a certain price.  He said that threshold was met June 20, the day after an action by the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission brought down ""all energy stock prices  across the board.""  Maviglio said he bought the stock for his individual retirement account, and  it has since declined in value. Under terms of the open order, he said, he  had no control over the exact date of purchase.  Maviglio touted the company in his role as spokesman to the governor in a  story published June 27 in The Bee. He said Monday that he was simply  responding to a reporter's question about the company's positive reputation.  ""They have made a clear commitment to invest in California's future,""  Maviglio said at the time. ""Their pricing has been far more reasonable than  any other generator.""  In the interview, Maviglio also contrasted Calpine and Texas-based  generators. He said Calpine ""took a different tack from the Joe Bobs of the  world,"" an apparent reference to Joe Bob Perkins, a senior executive with  Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston.  Maviglio acknowledged the stock ownership several days after the  administration ended its relationship with several energy consultants who  held stock in energy companies, including Calpine.  Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to  challenge Davis for governor next year, the Davis administration has spent  several weeks scrambling to answer questions about the stock holdings and  potential conflicts of its consultants and energy traders.  Jones said Monday that Maviglio should be fired.  ""These actions are unethical, unconscionable, unacceptable, and heads should  roll,"" he said in a statement. He said the Democratic governor should direct  all of his staff to immediately file updated conflict-of-interest statements  to reflect current holdings.  Jones, who last week asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to  investigate administration consultants for insider trading, also said the  probe should be expanded ""to include all of the governor's staff.""  Federal law and SEC regulations forbid anyone from trading stocks while  possessing ""insider information"" -- relevant facts not available to the  public, according to the SEC. Violations can bring lawsuits and criminal  prosecution.  Michael Prozan, a Menlo Park lawyer and expert on insider trading, said the  prohibition against it originally focused on halting company executives from  profiting from news before it was disclosed publicly.  But the laws have been broadened to include others besides company employees.  Investment bankers, lawyers and journalists have been snared by  insider-trading crackdowns.  Davis' office was instrumental earlier this year in paving the way for  removing barriers to construction of a Calpine plant in San Jose. On May 30,  after opposing the project for years, San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales announced  he had negotiated an agreement addressing his concerns and agreed to support  construction.  His action came after Davis in April endorsed the plant's construction and as  the state Energy Commission threatened to approve it over local objections.  On June 20, the company announced it had won tentative state approval to  build the plant.  Maviglio said he buys many stocks and that Enron Corp. and Calpine are the  only energy generators among them. He owns 100 shares of Enron stock, which  he purchased in 1996.  ""I deal with hundreds of California companies just about every day, and this  was one that I saw that looked like a good investment based on public  knowledge,"" he said. ""I read six newspapers a day or more, and I know what's  going on in the world. If there's a standard that I can't invest in something  that I have general public knowledge of, then I wouldn't have any stocks at  all.""  Maviglio said that the ""open"" order he placed meant that he could not have  used inside information to make his stock purchase.    Knox said.

2152,"FYI.  David Freeman and DWR....public power working for California. ******************************************************** Power delivery efficiency questioned: Output at low-cost generating plants  has been cut while costlier ones continue to operate. By Carrie Peyton Bee Staff Writer (Published July 31, 2001)  California is sometimes deliberately cutting output from low-cost power  plants while running more expensive ones, utility and grid officials say.  The sporadic episodes haven't cost much yet, but they illustrate a  potentially troubling disconnect in the system that has quickly grown between  two agencies that help deliver electricity to a power-strapped state.  ""We seem to be building this inefficiency into the system, and it doesn't  seem to be getting better,"" said Mike Florio, a consumer advocate who sits on  the governing board of the Independent System Operator.  The trouble is that the ISO, created in 1996 to manage the power grid in a  deregulated electric market, tries to run the grid by auctions that -- in  theory -- provide the cheapest electricity for the state's consumers.  Meanwhile, the state Department of Water Resources, which in January stepped  in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, isn't bidding at some  auctions because it believes it can provide cheaper power if it doesn't.  ""We have an inefficient market and an inept government entity. It's sort of  the worst of both worlds,"" Florio said, criticizing his agency and the DWR.  ISO staffers decline to discuss the situation in detail, saying it involves  confidential bidding behavior.  But Pete Garris, chief of operations for the power-buying arm of the  Department of Water Resources, confirmed that the ISO has been asking his  agency to take part in more auctions, but the state has declined.  The state's role is to buy electricity for customers of utilities whose  credit was no longer good enough to buy on their own, he said.  ""We're not in it to do those kinds of marketing functions,"" he said. ""It's  not necessarily a good fit.""  Some of the ISO auctions are used to lessen congestion on transmission lines.  Others are used to stabilize the grid by slightly increasing or decreasing  output when demand doesn't match forecasts.  Generally, the highest-cost power plants should be the ones cutting back, a  process the industry calls ""decking.""  But since May, on ISO orders, Southern California Edison has repeatedly  throttled back on the Mohave Generating Station, which produces some of the  cheapest power available to California today, costing as little as $10 to $20  a megawatt-hour.  Edison, which owns a majority share of Mohave, has cut its output by 5,660  megawatt-hours between May and July, about one-half of 1 percent, at the  ISO's behest, according to data Edison provided to The Bee.  The ISO could probably have saved the state's consumers $370,000 at one plant  if it had asked a higher-cost gas-burning plant to cut back instead of  Mohave, a coal-burning workhorse in Laughlin, Nev., Florio said.  The amount sounds like ""small potatoes,"" but in some ways it is more alarming  than the $14 million the state lost recently by selling excess power for less  than it paid, he said.  Industry experts agree that such below-cost sales are common in a business  where power needs fluctuate dramatically based on the weather.  By contrast, ""this is a dead weight loss. Higher costs are being incurred for  no good reason,"" Florio said.  ""The question is, why is the ISO calling on Mohave and not (cheaper) gas  plants? The answer is, the gas plants aren't bidding ... probably because  they're contracted with DWR,"" he said.  Four Corners, another low-cost coal plant partly owned by Edison, has also  been throttled back at ISO request, Edison officials said.  In addition, so few bidders have shown up at ISO auctions to ease stress on  transmission lines that the system has fallen into disarray, with the ISO  instead ordering across-the-board power production cuts that are boosting  costs, Florio said.  For its part, the ISO will say only that ""we are making the most economical  decisions we can based on the bids available,"" said spokeswoman Stephanie  McCorkle.  DWR's Garris said the state and the ISO have been meeting repeatedly on  bidding and other coordination issues, and he hopes to have a  smoother-running system in place by next summer.

2155,"Gouger Gray Davis  California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San  Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute. On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with  regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice  publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been  unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this  optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that  out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has  been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private  generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this  amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between  state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's  chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge  overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the  generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,  perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the  state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required  where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not.""  Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and  the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked  for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed,  Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a  ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality.  Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly  released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power  companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the  average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.  California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state  generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping  boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330  per megawatt hour.  Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis  spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators  who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that  are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off  by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""  Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it  turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business  consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in  ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The  state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the  current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state  power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices  are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to  eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power.  Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger,  Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad  policies. ",dasovich-j

I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought  I'd give you a quick update:  Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and  install some facilities in California.  With some effort, we persuaded Scott  that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job  done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).  Instead, Scott's going  to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the  project entails.  Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and  take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump  through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame  for approval would look like.  Scott agrees with this approach.  He's going  to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.  We likely will  regroup to figure out ""next steps"" right after the first of the year.  Have  any thoughts on this approach? I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.  However, this  Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area)  have had a little ""special  event"" planned for the past 6 months.   Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very  disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with  everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by  phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  ""Family and  relationships first!""  Hope all is well.

2228,"Folks:    The ""subcommittee"" I've referenced that's trying to come up with a solution  to California's train wreck is moving very quickly.  The group's shooting to  have a first cut at a ""straw person"" proposal sketched out by end of next  week.  The group's meeting on Tuesday to continue to bounce around ideas.    I'd like to try to have an internal call on Monday at either 10 AM (PST) or  3  PM (PST) to pin down at least a vaguely detailed conceptual framework that  I can propose to the subcommittee on Tuesday.  The agenda items for the  internal meeting are:  Finalize proposal for benchmark(s) for utility procurement.   Goal: increase utility willingness to enter into forward contracts by  replacing PUC after-the-fact ""reasonableness"" review with a benchmark. (Been  working the Portland desk on a ""portfolio benchmark"" concept.)  Determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t. the PX credit, i.e.,  should those contracts be disclosed to the market, or should PUC keep them  confidential, calculate the PX credit behind closed doors, and publish the  credit ex poste?  The PX credit depends on the overall utility portfolio, not  just the PX price.  Let me know if 10 AM or 3 PM (PST) works better.

Just between us chickens, it did come up as if you were implying that there's  some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit.  You can imagine  just how sensitive we are to that issue.

2240,"Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing  our relationships or commercial prospects.  Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over  the goal line:  On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that  make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state.   Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental  quality in California. That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are  going outside the state to build power plants.  Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the  legislation passed yesterday tinkers. Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to  keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price  spikes. If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a  dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will  continue, or worsen. California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now.  On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat  them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply  puts off the day of reckoning. It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your  door to collect. Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets  because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a  couple of years down the road. So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same  amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use  electricity wisely. There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with  another retail provider.   Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision  makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals  with companies like Enron.  But for the press reports, they hardly know  there's a crisis.",dasovich-j

Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers  Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on  NYMEX monthly prices.  So for example, based on November's forecast, the  utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.  When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual  prices.  If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the  utility will increase January's price forecast by ""just enough"" to make up  for the December undercollection.  If prices were too high and there's an  overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough  to refund the overcollection.  If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have  generally spread out the ""true-up"" over several months to avoid ""rate shock""  one way or the other.  However, under the current circumstances, the  utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the  entire undercollection in the following month.

For that  effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational  materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to  devise a solution to California's melt down.  The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.   1) ""do nothing""   2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the  amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed  priced power. 3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed  priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power,  c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept  fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.    The term of each scenario is 5 years.  Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly  equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as  one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher  under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.  The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that  in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy  a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if  undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

2297,"Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:  1. General May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the  same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's  ""import-based"" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state  infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about  80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the  in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the  last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border  and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California. The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can  we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?   If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we  need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving  FERC ammunition to take action without trying to ""steer"" that action in the  right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.  2. Specific Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The  midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest  (Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits  the California border.  	Mary H ",dasovich-j

2308,"Just met with the industry group trying to come up with a solution for  California.  The group liked our portfolio approach. In sum:   A portfolio approach is the right long-term solution. In the short run, our illustrative portfolios show that the utilities ought  to immediately fill a modest portion of their requirements via fixed-price,  long term contracts, and those contracts should be found reasonable, up  front, so long as the utility uses a competitive auction.  To stimulate  discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position  with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.  Everyone on the call liked the proposal.  After some discussion about whether  5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its  proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.

2382,,dasovich-j
2383,"Lara:  I have rather hastily put this list together.  For that I apologize.   Hope it is helpful.  The things on the list are ones that you've likely  already considered.  Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California  include:  1. POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are  also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail  markets. The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid.  The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the  utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors. This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level  (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility  can favor its subs plants via interconnection?).  2. DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable  solution to the price spikes. If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her  premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive  to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.  (Recall that in many places,  recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go  down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs). In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed  to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the  utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection.   This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers.  Utility  control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG  subs.  3. INTERCONNECTION/VOLTAGE BUY-UP And the same goes for the retail level---remember how SDG&E used  interconnection to thwart our deal with South West Marine in San Diego.  (Obviously, we're not doing these deals any more, but the interconnection  caused us ultimately to lose the commodity deal, too.)  4. TRADING PG&E and Sempra have developed significant trading units.   Now that the utilities have been granted authority to buy outside the PX, the  trading subs are getting more aggressive and vocal about the opportunity to  sell the utility power via short and long term power contracts.   Again, any sort of favoritism could do considerable harm to consumers and  competition (through the shareholders of the utilities' parent would surely  profit).  5. DISTRIBUTION In general, the utilities control over distribution is complete and it's a  problem (see DG, above, for example).   Shouldn't state and federal policy makers at least consider doing the  equivalent of FERC Order 888 (i.e., open access) at the distribution level?   Right now, distribution is a real black box.  6. RETAIL In California, the utility effectively controls customer sign-up, switching,  information, and turn back.  The problems have been significant.  7. MARKET INSTITUTIONS Finally, a big mistake in California was to replace one monopoly--the  utility--with another--the PX.   Because the utility has been forced to buy from the PX, and because the  market structure in California gives customers no incentive to switch, the  utility continues to control the overwhelming majority of the load in  California.   This gives the utilities monopsony power.  With that power, they can  influence PX prices.   Solution:  1) Don't make the PX a monopoly. 2) Create a system that provides  customers with the incentive to switch.  If you have any questions, or if there's anything else I can do to help,  don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

2414,"Ariba Hits Some Speed Bumps on the Fast-Growth Highway  By Joe Bousquin  Staff Reporter 9/7/00 3:21 PM ET  URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1070107.html  SAN FRANCISCO -- In a sign that the business-to-business software game is  tough even when you're on top, Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq) has been running into  problems this summer, both at home and abroad.  Ariba told analysts and investors at a private breakout session here Tuesday  at the Robertson Stephens Internet Conference that its business in Europe  this summer has been ""soft,"" according to Eric Upin, an analyst at the firm.  And at home, analysts are starting to talk about problems the company has had  integrating its Tradex software into its own and customers' systems.  An Ariba spokeswoman didn't immediately return a call seeking a comment.  The challenges Ariba is facing illustrate how difficult it can be to stay  ahead of the game in an emerging industry, even for one of its most  aggressive leaders. And they come at a time when its main competitor,  Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), is gaining momentum in key markets -- including  Europe -- through its partnership with German software maker SAP (SAP:NYSE  ADR).  Upin, who rates Ariba a buy and lists the company as one of his top B2B  picks, says the new concerns have to be taken in context. (His firm hasn't  performed underwriting for the company.)  ""Ariba's just getting ramped up in Europe, and Europe's slow during the  summer. It's a tiny part of their business,"" Upin said. ""But there was  concern because Ariba was saying that business was soft [in Europe] in  August.""  That concern has been reflected in Ariba's stock, which is trading just under  $162, off from its Sept. 1 close of $166.25. It fell 6.1% Wednesday after the  breakout session, though it's up about 3% Thursday. With the stock trading at  more than 70 times next year's projected sales, it's priced to perfection.  Ariba's softness in Europe comes at a time when Commerce One has been making  strides there. Its partnership with SAP has resulted in six new customers so  far. Commerce One also announced a joint marketing and sales alliance with  Intershop, another German software maker, on Thursday.  At home, Ariba has been encountering problems in integrating its Tradex  software, which enables users to participate in auctions over the Internet,  into its customers' systems, as well as into its own software platform.  Ian Toll, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, says those problems  shouldn't be viewed as too much of an impediment for Ariba. But they do  illustrate the complexities of building software that is designed to do  everything from manage back-office accounting systems to trade real-time with  outside partners.  ""Implementation has certainly been a concern with Tradex,"" Toll said.     But as competition increases in the B2B sector, those bumps are getting more  pronounced. ",dasovich-j

2416,"Folks:  My apologies in advance if I vent somewhat.    Briefly, some of you know that I attended Berkeley's Policy School.  I have  been very closely involved with the conference Severin describes in his note  to Littlechild.  I have been working to try to establish a joint venture  between the policy and business schools at Berkeley to hold an ""energy  summit,"" where national and international energy leaders would converge on  California (under the auspices of UC Berkeley) to talk energy policy.  Jim  Steffes has helped a lot in brainstorming the idea.  In short,, our goal was  to have a group of prominent folks squarely refute the extremely retrograde  notions of ""turn the clock back"" that the Governor of California's two most  recent appointees have been articulating at every opportunity over the past  several months, and re-seize the agenda in California. The ""energy heads of  state"" at the summit would come up with solutions for going forward.  The concept (and invitees) that Severin describes is loosely based on  proposals I have made to the ""steering committee.""  However, for reasons I  won't bore you with in this note, the effort has frankly turned into a  fiasco.  I notified the group this week that Enron would not be  participating, that they should go forward with the conference without us,  and that I would help somewhat (contacts, etc.) when (and if) they ever came  to agreement on the agenda and particpants.  From my perspective, the effort  turned out to be a rather big disappointment.  I urge us not to get involved  or contribute $$s.  At this juncture I would recommend against having Ken Lay  participate.  Depending on how the thing shapes up, we may  or may not want  to have someone at a substantially lower level participate, but I'm  pessimistic at this point.  If anyone would like to discuss my reasons in  more detail, I'd be happy to discuss.  I still think the idea of an energy summit is very promising.

2463,"Covisint Running Out of Excuses to Deliver on Its B2B Promise By Joe Bousquin  Staff Reporter 9/13/00 9:09 AM ET  URL: http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/1076377.html Uh-oh. Covisint can't blame it on the government anymore.  When word came Monday that the Federal Trade Commission had green-lighted the  Big Three automakers' Internet exchange, the business-to-business world  breathed a collective sigh of relief. That huge cloud of uncertainty, known  as government intervention, had been lifted.  Which means Covisint can't blame its state of disarray on the policy wonks  anymore. Instead, the company will have to execute on its B2B promise -- soon  -- for positive momentum to continue in the B2B sector.  The influence of the mega exchange, in which Ford (F:NYSE), General Motors  (GM:NYSE) and DaimlerChrysler (DCX:NYSE) plan to buy materials and supplies  on the Internet, has already affected the performance of business-to-business  stocks. Just look at Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq) on Monday, when Covisint's  FTC clearance was made public. It shot up $3.75, or 5.3%, to close at $75.13,  though it had traded as high as $78.13. But Tuesday, after the initial impact  of Covisint's clearance had waned, so did Commerce One's stock price. It  closed down $6, or 8%, at $69.12.  Similarly, when the antitrust issues started creeping onto the B2B scene, and  the government made known that it was looking at the exchange over antitrust  concerns, B2B stocks swooned. Now, going forward, how Covisint executes on  making B2B a reality, and not just the substance of a press release, will  surely play itself out on B2B stocks.  Right now, though, the company's prospect for swift and flawless execution of  its vision doesn't look good. It hasn't named a CEO. It hasn't finalized yet  where its headquarters will be. And perhaps most important, it has yet to  hammer out exactly what technology it will run on.  ""Covisint doesn't have a crutch or an excuse anymore,"" says Scott Crompton,  vice president for global automotive practices at consultant SeraNova.  ""Before, they could lean on the FTC as to why they weren't going forward, but  now, they're going to have to show some meaningful progress.""  To date, there has been anything but. In its first few months, the company  stumbled about nameless, until Covisint was decided upon. That moniker, which  is meant to evoke the ideals of communication, vision and integration,  instead elicited visions of corporate wonks sitting around a triangular table  white-boarding their separate goals.  All the while, the company had four interim co-CEOs and two competing  technologies to run on. Because Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq) had worked with Ford and  Commerce One with GM before Covisint was announced, the two software firms  were both brought into the deal. But ever since then, speculation has run  rampant over whether one firm would push the other out of the picture.  On Monday, Commerce One's CEO told TheStreet.com that the technology question  still hadn't been settled, even if the FTC's antitrust ones had.  Combine all those things and what you've got is the picture of a joint  venture between three highly competitive companies that's going nowhere fast.  Or, as Crompton puts it, Covisint is ""three different companies, two  different technologies and everyone talking about whether there's a lot of  arguing and infighting.""  But Covisint's already come up with someone else to blame. Now that the FTC  has passed, the company says that it's waiting for approval from the  Bundeskartellamt, or the German equivalent to the FTC. Covisint insists it  can't even begin operations in the U.S. until it gets the go-ahead from that  agency.  ""If you were a supplier and I was a manufacturer, both located in San  Francisco, we could not do business because the Bundeskartellamt still holds  this control over Covisint,"" says Thomas Hill, a Covisint spokesman.  ""Everyone at Covisint is anxious to start this business. Once the  Bundeskartellamt gives its blessing, we expect to see Covisint up and running  in 30 days.""  Hill concedes that might sound like another excuse for justifying its lack of  actual operations.  ""Sure, that might seem like another convenient excuse to delay a launch,""  Hill said. ""I would say if people could work 25 hours a day to get this done,  they would. ... Everyone at Covisint is focused on launching in a really  timely fashion.""  The company hasn't settled on a headquarters, in part, because it expects its  yet-to-be-named CEO to have some input into that decision. And as far as that  CEO goes, Covisint is still looking for one. Again, Hill said it was hard to  fill the spot when the FTC was probing the endeavor because of the  uncertainty that it brought with it.  ""If you're a CEO, why would you leave your current job and take the Covisint  job before the FTC approved it?"" Hill offered. ""And on the other hand, if  you're the FTC and you see the company you're reviewing hiring people, that  might make you look a little more closely at what they're doing.""  Both good points. But the fact remains that Covisint still has a lot more  work to do to get up and running, and these kinds of challenges tend to take  more time than expected, not less. And if those challenges become problems  for the company, the company could become a problem for the entire B2B  sector, as investors realize all over again how hard it will be to make B2B  work.  So the FTC's approval, while good for the ideal of B2B in general, might have  come a bit early for Covisint and the public B2B companies now trying to show  real results going forward.  ""My perspective is that this approval from the FTC is very important for the  industry as a whole, but it shouldn't be a suggestion that Covisint has  anything wonderful in the works,"" says Ben Smith, a consultant with A.T.  Kearney. (His firm is a subsidiary of EDS, which formerly was a part of  General Motors.) ""Now we can move on to execution. But this doesn't suggest  that Covisint has moved to that stage.""  Which means investors in B2B should watch the performance of this exchange  closely. ",dasovich-j

2468,"Thanks for the update.  Just want to add that 1) if we're uneasy about  wearing the full requirements risk, then focusing on offering a purely  wholesale deal can still be very attractive, given SDG&E's blunders w.r.t.  procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers.  And 2) the CPUC has  been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge, so  they'll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to pre-approve if a  deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and  that looks""attractive.""

2471,"The CPUC can do it it it wants---it's a decision about risk and reward.  If  the CPUC wants to set up a mechanism by which pre-approval is permitted, it  can do so.  Here's the catch, pre-approval means that the IOU has to be  willing (generally) to accept a bit more risk.  They don't like that.  The  CPUC has to be willing to relinquish a bit of control---this Commission  definitely doesn't like that idea.  So often, the utility puts up a proposal  that the Commission says places to much risk with granny.  The CPUC often  issues a decision in response that the utility claims leaves to much control  (read ""second-guessing"") with the Commission (and therefore leaves to much  risk with the utility).  In the end, the utility often ""declines"" the  Commission's offer.  However, it can be done.  For example, under  California's restructuring law, the utility's purchases from the PX are just  and reasonable, period.   (Of course, we see where the incentive built into  that mechanism got us--a debacle.)    Do you have PG&E's and Edison's proposals filed regarding bilaterals some  weeks ago, in which they propose certain pre-approval mechanisms?  The  Commission didn't adopt them wholesale, and the decision has made PG&E and  Edison reticent to sign any such as a result---witness the unfruitful RFPs.  This at all helpful?",dasovich-j

We need to remind the Commission that they gave 100 % pre-approved  reasonableness for purchases from the PX, and that pre-approval for other  purchases is necessary.

2534,"PG&E's $2 Billion Power Grab We've been gulled by our greedy utility  Ken Garcia Thursday,?September 14, 2000  ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/09/14/T Z110687.DTL  SAN FRANCISC -- The executives at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. sure try hard  to live up to their name, because I can't think of any company that has been  more adept at giving consumers a jolt.  The doyens of greed that rule over the California utility giant recently  revealed that they hope to pass on to customers more than $2 billion in  expenses -- ``unforeseen costs'' in the euphemistic view of the power  company, but unjustifiable rate increases to those of us residing in real  world.  The consumer-soaking surge is apparently based on PG&E's inability to predict  a rise in wholesale electricity prices, which is costing the company about  $700 million a month. Yet, as usual, the utility giant wants us to forget all  past promises and obligations, a favorite technique of energy merchants who  see rate increases as something that can be turned on with the flick of a  switch.  Lest anyone forget, a utility rate increase is exactly what California's  customers were told they would not get as a result of a deregulated power  market, which was supposed to lower -- not raise -- energy bills because of  an expected increase in competition.  It shouldn't come as a surprise that our friends at PG&E were among the prime  architects of the state's deregulation policy, which they now want to bend in  their financial favor. This is known as having your cake and (billing) Edith  too, because certainly she and her fellow customers wouldn't want the utility  company's stock to fall.  Now, I realize PG&E has been prone to blackouts over the years, but just  because it doesn't like the deal it forged and signed a few years back,  doesn't mean that its customers should be forced to pay for its lapses in  judgment. If you want to dance, you have to pay the fiddler -- even if it  turns out to be Nero and the electrical lines are burning.  ``It should be PG&E that eats the costs because they made the initial promise  that rates would go down,'' Dan Jacobson of the California Public Interest  Research Group told The Chronicle the other day. And he's right, even if the  state Public Utilities Commission once again buckles under and decides to  give PG&E a break it doesn't deserve.  While PG&E CEO Robert Glynn was trying to assuage analysts on Wall Street  this week that the soaring electricity rates would indeed be passed on to  customers, The Chronicle revealed that the state Board of Equalization has  quietly been granting utilities and giant corporations billions of dollars in  tax breaks. Despite a booming economy, the state agency has inexplicably  reduced the property tax assessments of PG&E, Pacific Bell and others to the  tune of $5.3 billion in the past year alone.  That's a lot of lost kilowatts and phone calls that could be used by  California residents. But in the world of utilities, it's always best to  leave the consumer in the dark.  In effect, the equalization board is improperly granting huge tax breaks to  companies worth billions, at the same time its assessments on homes and small  commercial properties are skyrocketing. And if you think something smells a  little rotten here -- well, it may just be the smoke rising from a lot of  consumers' ears.  You don't have to look far to see why officials at PG&E are feeling a little  desperate in their attempts to pass along their rising costs to consumers as  quickly as possible. Because the faster they can do it, the faster customers  might forget that PG&E had asked the PUC for an $800 million rate increase  earlier this year to help keep the lights in the corporate tower burning.  The utility was granted a $450 million increase, even though an  administrative law judge found that the company needed only half that amount  to meet its expenses. But what's a few hundred million between friends?  Yet the funny part is, PG&E officials said that rate increase would actually  lower our gas and electric bills, an event that happens on our shores about  as often as a tsunami. This energy-defying trick, which I first questioned in  February, would take place, we were told, because of cost savings within the  utility giant's other divisions. Yet if they were making more money, why did  PG&E need the PUC to give it close to a half billion in bill increases?  Well, the answer is that it would appear there are quite a few dim bulbs  making decisions about California's energy market, and Gov. Gray Davis hasn't  seen fit to replace them.  So don't be shocked if PG&E again gets its way, and once again customers are  ``serviced'' by state regulators to the tune of hundreds of millions in rate  increases, no matter how unfair or undeserved. PG&E said it would foot the  bill when it pushed for deregulation, and now that it's taking a huge hit for  past decisions, it wants to pass the buck.  It takes time to build up a reputation for Power, Greed & Excess. Energy  companies, after all, are anything but utilitarian.

2597,"We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few  months.  But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my  mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some  observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.  OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is  increasing.  The administration is hell bent on finding a ""fall guy.""  The price spikes  pose real political risks for Davis and he and his folks need and want an  easy way out.   His press release following the hearing renewed the call for  ""refunds.""  On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her  with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to  marketers.  And Carl Wood's remarks were extreme. At the Barton hearing, a liberal democrat (Filner) and a conservative  Republican (Hunter) locked arms in calling for refunds. Bilbray joined the  ""gouging"" band wagon. The utilities repeatedly called on FERC to do a ""real"" investigation, with  hearings, testimony, data discovery---the works.  On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and  his remarks on the panel.  Wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature  of California's market structure makes it impossible to single out a single  participant as the culprit.  He also stated that just everyone's just acting  in their own self-interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in  the structure.  IMPLICATION--It seems prudent for Enron to understand better its risks of  getting fingered.  In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides.  In which case, the  only cost to Enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the  risks of getting fingered. In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by  the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of  California consumers.  ",dasovich-j

2603,"Thanks Roger.  Here are the highlights of today's hearings:   Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much. Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged  that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is  necessary. Due process matters.  If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and  increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law  suits will ensue. Don't jump the gun.   A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of  the utilities' proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the  utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required  to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities  implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the  Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4. No more divestiture.   The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission  should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all  customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities'  hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the  state control over some generation. Treat all customers equally and fairly. The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v.  small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to  save another. Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.  As such, the  Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate  problem.  A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission  should do no more.  At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission  asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the  Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without  declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in  raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can   Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly.   A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC  commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning  the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the  exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.  2. Next steps There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue  through Friday. Tomorrow, lawyers will provide ""oral"" arguments on whether the Commission  must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it  does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial  exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and  01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates  without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should  do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair  hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to  persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this  is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking. After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and  ""all interested persons"" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the  utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo). When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and  providing comments, the President of the Commission responded ""we don't know,  it's evolving.""  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of  ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is ""appeal-proof."" Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is  still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively  offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other  stakeholders to our side. We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.  We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.  Best, Jeff    	Roger Y ",dasovich-j

2614,"Today's hearing was dominated by : 1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the  ""rate freeze"" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can  rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on  an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and,  1) an appearance by Ralph Nader.  The Legal Issue In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction.  Whether it  sticks remains to be seen, however.  We proposed that:  The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate  freeze issue. The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have  provided  the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied  to the rate freeze.  And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law  suits, which is in no one's best interest. For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to  determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the  utilities' access to capital markets. (We've taken no position on whether  there's a need to raise rates.) setting a hearing schedule to examine the ""rate freeze"" and all related  issues thoroughly and methodically.  The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate  freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to  attack in the courts.  (In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end  the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit  the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs.  Under the rate  freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate  freeze.)  In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past  Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to  raise rates if it found it necessary to do so.  Many other parties agreed  with our position.  A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a  call.  During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta  Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the  Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the  rate freeze issues.   The Ralph Factor Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still  looking for work.  He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy  news conference.  From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at  the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and  willing to bail the utilities out.  Even when thrown some soft balls about  ""out of state generators,"" Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the  utilities.  But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have  said things that I missed.  The Next Steps The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week.  Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial  hardship.  Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as  does the PUC).  The utilities will also have the chance to question the  consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the  Commission. On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate  increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should  shoulder.   More tomorrow on the call.

2617,"The Hearings The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like  environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility  witnesses. The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship. The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E  witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices  since restructuring started in 1998. Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for  investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g.,  dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and  parent's use of that cash for investment activities).   Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the  utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from  parent, bankruptcy). The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward  PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings  progress. Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by  Edison witness. Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to  issue its decision on Thursday. At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed  the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general  ratemaking authority.  Outside the Hearing Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management  continue. Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities  inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain  some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room. Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with  utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any  rate increases. Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission  absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor  follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of  the state speech on the 8th.",dasovich-j
2618,"Thanks for the articles.  Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home,  which is some consolation.  PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas  suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.  Our  exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if  we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its  decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.

2622,"Another Utility Bailout Should Leave Us Cold  George Miller Sunday, December 31, 2000  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/12/31/E D134916.DTL  OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious. But before the governor  and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers  billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of  system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more.  Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might  benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not  happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders.  The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition  out of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every  bad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities.  Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California  ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities  themselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize  the losses.  Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities  came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from  federal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for  all parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit  from the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them  if wholesale prices were to go up.  This, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk.  This was the brave new world of free markets.  But markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was  designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially,  consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have  provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five  years. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want  again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets.  At first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities  Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's  risks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test.  Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a  substantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse  financially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC  to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures.  During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America.  PG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T,  it may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the  American marketplace.  PG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the  ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year,  tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various  Silicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of  going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout.  The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that  utilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional  payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would  ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The  ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration.  George Miller is a Democratic congressman from Martinez. ",dasovich-j

But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before  creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with  the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)    With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while  some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and  commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.  That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But  if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy  themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate  increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional  opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims  and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.

2690,"The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared  yesterday.  Three key changes: They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the  entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now). The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of  gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will  consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to  lower chances of a successful utility appeal). The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the  pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will  submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature. On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that  legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the  utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result  of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office,  the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the  decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs  credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the  utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is  currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're  working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in  California, to get more info and will report back.

Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,   made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy. The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next  meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the  utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is  reached, it could end up on the next agenda.",dasovich-j

2701,"I sent Kari Dohn some more information today--thanks, Jim, for the  Pennsylvania info.  In the note, I asked her if the rumors about  securitization are true, and whether the Governor, indeed, intends to push it  actively.    I also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option, particularly  if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities.  The response  from Kari is very encouraging, and will hopefully help the utilities' credit  position, though I heard PG&E was downgraded to junk by at least one credit  agency today, but haven't confirmed it.    Think it's prudent to keep Kari's info very close to the vest--here's  Kari'her response:  Jeff -- thank you so much for the information!  Re:  securitization, I don't think the exact form has been decided in terms of legislation, but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the highest level regarding the best way to do this (with good support, between us, it appears).  All major parties will need to be supportive.",dasovich-j

2710,"Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely  to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.   Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing  ""credit receivables"" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that  the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with  it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing  conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.  But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be  significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron  meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the  ""complex process""  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border  gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch  from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an  emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the  Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.  It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of  all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may  find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of  EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the  utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned  negative on ESPs as a result.

2825,"Michael Tribolet:  In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court  in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the  rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its  undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court  agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass  through the power purchase costs to customers.)  The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but  said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to  us to make a copy for ourselves.

2873,"The speaker introduced a bill that would:  Order the CA PUC to establish a ""rate component"" to permit the utilities to  recover its ""net undercollected amount"" over a period of ten years.  (Sounds  like there may be a haircut in there somewhere.) Authorize the State Water Dept. to purchase power on behalf of utilities and  munis. Order the CA PUC to create a separate rate component to cover the Dept.'s  cost of purchasing the power. Authorize the Treasurer to issue debt, backed by ratepayers, to cover any  difference between the price the Water Dept. buys the power for and the price  that can be collected from ratepayers under the rate freeze. Authorizes the State Director of Finance to ""accept on behalf of the state  any tangible asset of an electrical corporation.""

Seems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating  the ""end"" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive ""end""  and 3) one ""freeze"" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will  continue to be capped going forward (despite the ""end"" of the rate freeze).

2920,"Hey, nice spreadsheet.  Two minor questions:   1) Isn't the provision for taxes on the income statement actually the taxes  on the 'income' they made from using the sales method (equal to 46%), rather  than what they pay will actually pay the IRS under the installment method?  I  think the notes show how instead of paying the 4.1$ based on their recognized  income, they pay some itty bitty amount based on installment.  If so, I think  they actually get a 46%  tax break on the 1 million and change that they lose  using a cash basis.  Still a loss, just not so big.  Anyway, I'm not sure if  I'm thinking straight on this, but that's how I read the numbers.  2) Does the balance sheet have to change a little?  For example, does  shareholder equity change since the income that goes to retained earnings is  now a loss, rather than a gain?  Also, if revenue is recognized on a cash  basis and is now much smaller, there needs to be another liability to equal  out the decrease in revenues with the still large notes receivables on the  asset side (as you note in the answer the notes recievables stays the same).   Seems like they might need a liability like ""deferred profits"" or some such  thing, such that the [""deferred profits"" +  revenues (recognized on cash  basis)] = notes receivables.

They are concern= ed=20 that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual= =20 deal, which for obvious reasons they don=01,t want to do.  Peevey and Freeman also said that they don=01,t want to sign too many long-= term=20 contracts though they recognize that there=01,s a trade-off between term an= d=20 price.

Ken=  Lay=20 pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds= =20 needed to pay suppliers.  The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposa= ls.  Response from Peevey/Freeman: Be as creative as possible.  All offers will be considered (despite the=20 language contained in the RFP).  The only customers who have been protected from California=01,s failed=20 restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct=20 Access.  In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California=01,= s=20 shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site=20 generation.  Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01= *as=20 AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.  Response from Peevey: He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.

3046,"On the various matters currently before the California PUC: The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference  between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically  in effect.  (The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under  the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.) The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission  that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order  altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would  need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls. The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.  In  addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a  regularly scheduled business meeting next week.  So the opportunity to act  and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it. With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating  assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that  foresses a Commission decision adopting an ""interim"" procurement charge on  March 27th.  There is another ""workshop"" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss  the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file  formal ""advice  letters"" with the Commission.  Those advice letters will form  the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at  a decision on the 27th. Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that  customers will  see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that  DWR incurs to buy power.  Everyone participating in the workshops also takes  the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the  Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole.   (Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that  it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops.  And until there is  clarity on whether the Commission will agree to ""pass through"" those costs,  Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it  applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.) Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started  to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the  utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to ""net out"" the utilitities'  generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap,  the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc.    Recently, TURN modified  its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.  TURN's new position is  that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st,  the effective date of AB1X.   EES will need to quickly determine how and if  it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze. We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA  customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities'  stranded generating assets.  That compensation could come in one of two  forms:  1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained,  cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference  between the ""market"" value of the retained generating assets and the book  value of those assets.  We are not getting much traction thus far. The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate  freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues  against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.  So both sets of issues (the  procurement charges and the ""end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be  ""finalized"" on March 27, albeit in separate orders. With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting  on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers.  However, it  has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on ""charge  backs"" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward  issue.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

Please do not hesitate to contact m= e=20 if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi= ng=20 else that I can do to assist you.  Regards, Ken    1. Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American=20 Tribes in Installing Small-scale Generation on  Tribal Lands  David Parquet, Vice-President Enron North America 101 California Street, Suite 1950 San Francisco, CA 94111 Phone: 415.782.7822   2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation  Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=  a=20 step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs.  We would propose lifting the cap through amendment= s=20 to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development of distributed=20 generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.  Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=  or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore faces all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20  Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects= . =20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.  3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20  Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward.  Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue  Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X leaves ambiguous whether DWR has any authority to char= ge=20 California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our analysis= =20 of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PU= C=01, s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  As such, suppliers= =20 have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rates adequate=20 charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.  Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.  Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20  We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options:  Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&XXXX=018.)  Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled, =01&XX= XX.=018)  Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that it prefers to pursue the second options, that is,=20 clarifying the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through contract= =20 amendments.  4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001  Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates, a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports showing= =20 that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They differ only o= n=20 how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  All credib= le=20 sources agree supply supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of=20 2001. =20  CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be this summer short by=20 approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our estimates. =20 California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below = the=20 average 15-20% which is recommended for reliable system operation in the=20 West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than oth= er=20 regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the unpredictability= =20 of the weather and the dry year the West has had thus far.  In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess the=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to= =20 this.  Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the= =20 early draw down of reservoirs close the supply-demand gas this summer,=20 emissions restrictions on existing plants, and a reduced number of customer= s=20 who can be curtailed.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at= =20 the current pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies= =20 will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earlies= t.  CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optomistic scenario, banking that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that the=20 California should view the CEC's predictions regarding increased supply wit= h=20 considerably skepticism.  5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis  This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.  As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California cris= is=20 must focus on four issues:  Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency  Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year.  In California, complex and costly air quality regulations=20 exacerbate California=01,s inability to site power plants. =20  The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by:  Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X Because of the delay in implementing a solution to California=01,s electric= ity=20 crisis, closing the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and=20 efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This= =20 can be accomplished most effectively and quickly in two ways:  Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=  more=20 cheaply by running an auction to determine the payments businesses would be= =20 willing to receive to reduce demand for a sustained period (e.g., through t= he=20 summer months).  DWR could very easily run an on-line auction to determine= =20 the best price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To participate,= =20 businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to=20 monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions.  Enron= =20 has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&Dealbench,=018 that = it would=20 be willing to contribute to the effort.  Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment  To work, customers need access to the following key elements:  An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification. Settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be= =20 paid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).  The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ= e:  =01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti= cularly=20 in the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation= =20 resources. reduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20 electric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity = in=20 the state. fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris= k=20 of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20 customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for= =20 responding.=20  We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in= =20 excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for= =20 summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs who would also pay= =20 Access Fees could be 2 to 3 times that amount.  We recommend that the State= =20 of California provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installatio= n=20 of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailmen= t=20 implementation.  Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access.  In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20 therefore begin now to gradually phase the utility out of the procurement= =20 function entirely, with the goal having all customers served by a non-utili= ty=20 provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, California should ho= ld=20 a competitive solicitation in which competing service providers would bid f= or=20 the right to serve segments, or =01&tranches,=018 of utility load.  Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers= =20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ= ia=20 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend= ed=20 period of time.  California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a= =20 series of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20 increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without= =20 =01&shocking=018 the economy or consumers=01, wallets (e.g., amortize the r= ecovery of=20 the utilities=01, debt over a 5-10 year period). The magnitude of the rate= =20 increase can be reduced in two ways: First, the utilities could absorb some= =20 portion of their existing debt in recognition of the risk they accepted whe= n=20 they agreed to the structure of AB 1890.  Second, California can =01&net=01= 8 the=20 revenues the utilities have received from selling electricity into the Powe= r=20 Exchange against the debts they have accrued due to the retail price cap.

3139,"Greetings All:  First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i= s=20 very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this= =20 morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.  Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f= or=20 delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:  I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would= =20 be appreciated. As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to ""wallpaper"" Sacramento wi= th=20 our proposed legislation. This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the ""final"" version= s=20 of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20 believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today. You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver = to=20 his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20 Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed= =20 legislation to the rest of the world at the same time. When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20 determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same= =20 time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will= =20 handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom= =20 you've decided to circulate. This email does, however, include a ""summary"" of our proposed legislation. = =20 But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20 appropriate language to distribute ""to the world,"" or if we'll need instead= =20 to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a ""one=20 pager"" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the= =20 package effectively. We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20 proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul= d=20 propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the= =20 Direct Access coalition? We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the = PR=20 machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20 legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we= =20 can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted= =20 Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term. You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR= =20 credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=  =20 You note that attached to the email is a ""legislative fix"" to AB1X that cou= ld=20 solve the credit issue and an attached set of ""taking points"" related to a= =20 second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha= t=20 DWR will get its money for power purchase costs. Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to= =20 get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20 brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20 (legislative solution) under the topic ""create a real competitive retail=20 market in California.""  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20 legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20 discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.

3181,"Hi Rosalee: Steve Kean asked that I send you this note for transmittal to Ken Lay.  Mr.= =20 Lay may receive a call from David Freeman regarding on-going power=20 negotiations between the California Department of Water and Enron, but it i= s=20 not certain that he will call.  In the event that he does phone, we would= =20 like to make sure that Mr. Lay gets this information prior returning the=20 call.  Thanks very much for your help.  All the best, Jeff  Mr. Lay:  As you know we've been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hamme= r=20 out a power deal with CDWR.  The big issue getting in the way of the deal= =20 continues to be credit. I've attached the summary of the credit issues and= =20 possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator= =20 Brulte last week.  As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit=20 issues, Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman= =20 yesterday.  That letter is also attached.  In sum, the letter:  expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit= =20 issues,and, requests payment for power previously delivered to CDWR and pre-payment for= =20 any new deliveries.  In response, David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment= =20 that 1) we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR, despite your meeting with= =20 Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago, and 2) we would make a= =20 power deal contingent upon a) payment for power previously delivered to DWR= =20 and b) pre-payment for any future deliveries.  Freeman suggested that we=20 could sign the deal for 200 MWs of power now, but then back out of the deal= =20 if CDWR fails to get adequate credit provisions in place within the next fe= w=20 weeks.  Given the political climate in California, we are of course not=20 anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and=20 announce later that we are backing out of the deal, since doing so would=20 place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position.  Instead, we= =20 continue to suggest that it's best for all parties to have the credit issue= s=20 resolved up front.  You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues= =20 further.  As you know, the credit issues are significant and we are working= =20 hard to overcome those issues.  But in the current climate, where the=20 Governor and the Legislature are actively discussing a complete takeover of= =20 the electric industry in California, getting the contract issues right is= =20 critical.  Regards, Jeff Dasovich   SUMMARY OF CREDIT ISSUES FROM BRULTE EMAIL  Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20  Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward.  Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue  Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.  Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.  Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20  We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues.  We have identified three options:  Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)  Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the ""legislative"" fix.  We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20 =01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)  Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments.  LETTER FROM CHRIS CALGER TO DAVID FREEMAN  February 19, 2001   S.

3224,"Davis Signals Utility's Grid Could Be Seized  Power: Governor says eminent domain is a possible last resort against PG&E,  which is balking in state sales negotiations.  By DAN MORAIN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers  On the eve of a new round of rescue negotiations with a reluctant Pacific Gas  & Electric Co., Gov. Gray Davis suggested Wednesday that as a last resort the  state could seize the utility's prized electrical transmission system through  eminent domain. That saber-rattling cut against the grain of some rare good news in the  state's continuing electricity crisis. The energy supply crunch eased  slightly as grid operators pumped up the cushion between supply and demand,  and for the first time in more than five weeks the statewide power grid was  operating under a relatively mild Stage 1 emergency. Negotiations with the state's two other big utilities--Southern California  Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric--were described by a Davis aide as going  ""very well."" But the governor, responding to a reporter's question, would not rule out the  idea of taking over transmission assets through eminent domain, a legal  proceeding by which government can take over private property, at a price  determined by a court. His aides downplayed the possibility, and Davis said  he intends to continue talking with utility executives in an effort to  resolve the weighty questions. ""My strong preference is to do this through [a] cooperative negotiation  process rather than just seize it,"" Davis said at a brief news conference at  an elementary school south of Sacramento. Davis is insisting that the utilities give up control of the massive system  of high-voltage transmission lines in exchange for an infusion of state money  that would allow Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to  restructure their multibillion-dollar debts. While Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric executives have said they are  willing to discuss the sale of their portion of the 32,000-mile statewide  grid, PG&E, the state's largest utility, is balking. ""The governor would like to solve this thing in one fell swoop, but if PG&E  is sitting up there being obdurate, then this thing is severable,"" Davis  political advisor Garry South said in Los Angeles. The utilities need the state's help to buy electricity, as wholesale prices  have soared since May and supplies have been stretched to the limit. Under  the state's limited deregulation plan, the companies were forced to buy  wholesale power at market prices but were not allowed to pass along increased  costs to customers. Internal administration documents circulated in the Capitol last week show  that the state was considering paying 2.3 times the grid's ""book value,"" or  about $7.3 billion, for the grid serving all three companies. A top utility source, requesting anonymity, said the figure was in the  ""ballpark"" of what was being discussed. Talks will continue today with all three utilities. Davis had not decided  whether he would join the talks directly, or leave that task to his aides,  San Francisco attorney Michael Kahn and former Southern California Edison  executive Michael Peevey. ""We're still hopeful for an announcement by Friday,"" Davis spokesman Steve  Maviglio said Wednesday night.  Transmission Grid the Key Davis insisted that the transmission grid is key to any deal. The utilities  would use cash from the purchase to restructure debt and the state would use  its ability to raise money through bond sales to revamp the aging system,  which is said to need $1 billion in improvements. ""That will be part of the solution,"" Davis said. ""I will not sign off on a  resolution of this [without the transmission grid]."" South, the governor's chief political advisor, acknowledged that PG&E is in  more difficult financial straits than Edison, largely because the PG&E  electricity rate structure set by the Public Utilities Commission is lower. But he added that Edison has shown more good faith and interest coming into  the negotiations, which began Tuesday in San Francisco. ""Edison's been coming into these meetings with 50-page binder books with  various specific proposals,"" South said. ""PG&E comes in with a handwritten  piece of paper and a big huff of arrogance. They act like they are in control  when they are in serious soup."" A spokesman for PG&E declined to comment on South's remarks. The utility has  maintained a policy of not discussing the negotiations. PG&E's parent company, PG&E Corp., announced Wednesday that it would not be  paying its regular dividend of 30 cents per share on common stock for the  first quarter of 2001. PG&E said it would not resume paying common stock  dividends until it ""determines that the financial health of the company will  support such action."" The company has come under intense criticism that it is maintaining a  business-as-usual approach while its utility subsidiary was teetering toward  bankruptcy. While the negotiations with PG&E threatened to prolong the political crisis,  the state was emerging from 39 straight days of moderate-to-critical power  supply emergencies, having been lifted into the relative calm of a low-level  alert by warmer weather, improved electricity reserves and a decrease in the  number of power plant shutdowns. ""We should probably be making a big deal about this, but we just don't have  time,"" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent  System Operator, which balances supply and demand on the electricity grid  serving about 75% of the state. The grid controllers have been operating in full crisis mode for months now,  using everything short of the Energizer bunny to keep electricity flowing  while state leaders looked for solutions to the power market meltdown.  Economic Uncertainty For more than a month, the state's transmission grid has been operating under  either a Stage 2 or Stage 3 emergency, indicating extremely tight reserves.  At noon Wednesday, the grid bumped down to Stage 1--indicating that the state  was maintaining reserves at a relatively cushy 7%. That is still below what  grid operators consider prudent, but no one was complaining. The full effect of the electricity crisis on the state's economy is not yet  clear, and independent Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill urged state  lawmakers Wednesday to take a ""wait-and-see"" approach as they craft a new  budget. Still, she left no doubt that she believes the power problems could seriously  crimp California's economic outlook. Hill said she believes it is safe to assume that electricity costs will rise  because of the gap between wholesale prices and regulated rates. If wholesale  prices were to stay as high as they are now, she estimated, the state's  wholesale electricity costs would climb to $40 billion this year, up from $25  billion in 1999. Hill made no prediction about whether that would happen. Indeed, Brad  Williams, a senior economist in Hill's office, said he thought it likely that  prices would decline and that legislation would shield consumers from the  full effect of the inflated electricity market.  30-Day Supply Agreement Also Wednesday, Reliant Energy of Houston, which has balked at being forced  to provide electricity to California when payment for that power is  uncertain, said it had reached a 30-day agreement with the state under which  the company will continue to provide emergency electricity supplies. As a result, a federal judge in Sacramento delayed ruling on a lawsuit filed  by state grid operators against Reliant. Instead, U.S. District Judge Frank  C. Damrell Jr. extended until Friday afternoon an order forcing Reliant and  several other energy suppliers to keep selling to the California grid  operators. In Huntington Beach, city officials delivered a blow to Davis' plan to  accelerate power plant projects, filing an appeal with the California Energy  Commission to fight the speedy reactivation of two old gas-fired generators.  If they exhaust that process without stopping the plan, they promised to go  to court. Regardless of whether the appeals succeed, they are likely to tie up the  approval process, and in that sense strike against the heart of the  governor's plan to expedite power plant projects to meet the energy shortfall  expected this summer. The AES units--with a combined output of 450 megawatts, enough to serve  450,000 typical homes--represent about 10% of the 5,000 megawatts that Davis  assured power-starved Californians would be available in time for the summer  peak. ---  Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles, Richard Simon in  Washington, Julie Tamaki and Rone Tempest in Sacramento and Christine Hanley  in Orange County contributed to this story.

3233,"Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001)  Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when  he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an  agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom.  Problem is, it won't work out that way.  Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have  produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today.  Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before.  For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that  haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive  progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them  on Friday afternoons after financial markets close.  The Democratic governor's office scheduled an ""announcement"" for today in Los  Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away.  Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by  setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing  the state's credibility in the process.  ""I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase  of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem  realistic,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an  association of wholesale generators. ""I guess the people I represent have  turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure.  Here's another photo op.' ""  Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the  utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities.  ""I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what  should go in a piece of legislation,"" he said at the time. ""And hopefully,  that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week.""  Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic.  Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and  Electric Co., but no agrement was reached.  ""These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,"" said PG&E  spokesman Ron Low. ""On some issues, we are very far away from agreement.""  Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission  lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress  was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and  Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks  with them were far from concluded.  Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for  months:  In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive ""plan"" by Dec.  1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a  modest slate of proposals.  Davis called Feb. 12 a ""drop dead"" date by which he hoped to cement a deal  between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet.  Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach  a ""consensus agreement"" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday.  It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone.  Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton,  said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of  politics is to delay.  However, he cautioned against missing deadlines.  ""You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because  the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its  value as a political tool,"" Panetta said.  The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing  consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power  Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York.  At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the  utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official  deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a  judge's discretion.  ""Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,"" Fetter said. ""The problem  is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a  deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers.""  In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news  conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail.  On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan  to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated.  One prong of the plan: ""Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation  and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities.""  Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set  deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress,  particularly to Wall Street.  He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed.  ""Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to  foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather,  you name it,"" Maviglio said. ""The governor sets deadlines that continue to  move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that.""  Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering  suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate  the markets.  Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is  commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or  tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said.  ""You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction  to a news flash going over the wire,"" he said.  But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in  early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their  performance.  ""There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that  I don't think it makes much of a difference,"" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice  president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. ""It's beyond that  point now.""  ",dasovich-j

3269,"ON THE GRID OR OFF THE GRID Bigger Is Better An interstate electricity highway could leverage economies of scale to keep  the lights on Burton A. Weisbrod, Glen E. Weisbrod Sunday,?February 25, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/25/S C177059.DTL  WE COULD HAVE left it to the states. When the Interstate Highway System was  proposed nearly 50 years ago, we could have said, ""Leave it to each state to  decide on its roads and to pay for them, or leave it to private enterprise to  build toll roads wherever it is profitable."" Fortunately, we didn't.  Today, vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated  high-capacity roads that crisscross the nation. There are many differences  between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity. But just as  the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of  people and goods across the states, allowing enormous economic and social  gains, so, too, do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of  power across state lines.  Many forces are at work contributing to California's electricity crises, and  power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible. The  growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for  electricity. Legislative constraints, reflecting environmental protection and  other concerns, have discouraged construction of electricity-generating  plants.  Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short-  term power shortages. And, in an oddity of California law, the prices that  power producers can charge distributors are deregulated, while the prices  that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted.  But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and  demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit  substantial amounts of electricity to flow, as highway traffic does, from one  state to another.  Interstate transmission connections do exist now, but are limited in  capacity. They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated  with local power emergencies, not for sustained use. If those interstate  lines were upgraded to greater capacity, then we could move toward actually  creating a national power grid.  An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among  producers of electric power across the nation, and far more options to meet  demand in any local area. No state or region would need to depend simply on a  small number of generating producers within its borders, and the increased  number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and  lower prices.  The underlying problem is basically one of incentives. With the maze of  state, and federal regulations on the production, distribution and pricing of  electricity, there is great risk and little incentive for private  construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders.  Imagine a power plant in state A, but near state B, with that plant  occasionally having excess production capacity. There is no market for the  power in state B, but there is demand for it in state C, which is adjacent to  it. In a smoothly functioning, efficient, power transmission system, power  would move from the generating plant in state A, across the border for use in  state B, thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could  be sent to state C. Through such a domino-like process, power available in  one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area - with  only a series of relatively short-distance transmissions.  Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what  the federal government can and should foster. It would strengthen the nation;  it would expand options for users; it would increase competition among  suppliers, to the benefit of consumers; it would overcome the multiplicity of  state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for  profitable interstate power transmission.  The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nation's  escalating population of cars, and it was not cheap. But, designed to  maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas, with ample systemwide  capacity to spare, it did transform the country, binding the 48 contiguous  states into an integrated whole.  The effect: reduced costs and increased ""exports"" of California fruits and  vegetables to the Midwest, and reduced costs, along with increased exports of  Midwest manufactured products to the West.  Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate  country, building roads just for its own residents, or growing all of its own  food supply, it is equally inefficient for each state to independently  develop its own power supply. It is foolish to find electricity producers in  one state claiming that they should not ""help out"" consumers in another  state.  A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity  demand in various parts of the country, seasonally and even in the course of  a day.  To consumers and industrial users in California, the effects of a national  electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring, but not  spectacular. It would, however, go far to achieving the quiet result that  every consumer seeks - lower prices, more reliable electric power supplies.  There is no single solution to California's energy crisis, but developing a  national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing  it. Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state  control. The federal government's role would be largely to provide financial  incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity, and  to establish standards for its design and utilization - just as is the case  with the Interstate Highway System.  A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings  Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the  Top Seven governmental achievements of the last 50 years - along with  rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote. An  interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top  achievements of government in the next half-century.  MACRO POWER TRANSMISSION WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California. In fact, we have two  problems: a short-term problem and a long-term problem.  Short term, the problem, from the consumer perspective, is:  -- Soaring electricity bills.  -- Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity  distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. either in rate increases or  higher taxes.  -- The threat, and to some users the reality, of no lights, no refrigeration,  no heat.  These concerns are real and severe. But they are merely symptoms of a serious  long-term crisis: Incentives to the power industry are wrong!  As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago, we do not look to the good  intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest; we look to  their self interest. Then, as today, wise public policy calls for aligning  the two, by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system  that provides power that is dependable, is produced efficiently and is  distributed competitively, so that prices are low.  This long-term problem will not be solved by the series of Band-Aids that  governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing  over. Now is the time to develop a long-term plan.  Two elements of a long-term plan for efficient and reliable electricity are  clear:  -- Electricity self-sufficiency for each state is bad policy. It is easy to  think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem.  It is not. Trade and competition mean access to more producers, and that can  bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food, electronics or autos,  as low-cost sources are utilized. (Promoting more interstate options does not  preclude building more local generation, and small, ""micro"" electricity  generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy.  However, the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their  generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand.)  -- Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission.  It does no good to have low-cost power production unless the power can reach  users. This is why the federal government has such an important role to play  in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway  system.  --Burton A. Weisbrod and Glen E.

Gray Davis  said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this  summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about 10  percent.  In addition, he said, the state must get more electrical power online by  then.  His call for a 10 percent cut is a significant jump from the 7 percent he was  asking for during his State of the State speech last month, and it may be a  difficult stretch for consumers. Davis made his remarks on NBC's news show  ""Meet the Press.""  State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, praised the governor's statement on  national television.  ""The most important thing right now is that the governor said that, because  there has been general skepticism statewide, reflected both in anecdotes and  public opinion polls, that we are in fact facing a crisis,"" Perata said. ""If  you don't believe, you won't conform, you won't respond.""  But, he said, Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers  are given financial incentives. Perata said he will propose legislation today  to give $1 billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during  the summer months.  Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of  California at Berkeley, said if temperatures soar this summer, it will take a  ""huge effort"" to keep the state at safe electricity levels.  NEED FOR CONSERVATION ""We are in big trouble,"" Borenstein said. ""That doesn't mean we can't avoid  blackouts -- that means we will have to take serious measures.""  The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and  industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and  hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems, he said. For residential  users,  he said, it will mean increases for use above a certain level.  Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least 5,000 megawatts this summer, but  the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System  Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power  grid, removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month.  Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California ISO, said that she does not  expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions  about the summer power situation.  ""We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in  the state,"" O'Donley said. ""Conservation is a big part of it, and whatever  people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in  avoiding blackouts.""  GOVERNOR DODGES BLAME Davis appeared on ""Meet the Press"" while visiting Washington, D.C., for a  meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the  Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. With him on the program  were Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Republican  Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.  Davis took the opportunity of the high-profile television show to tell East  Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the state's  energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking  solid steps to resolve the problem.    he  said.

3270,"FYI.  Per our call today, some press from Saturday referencing PG&E's  opposition to having Comrade Davis buy its Tx assets.   Power-Lines Deal Davis, Edison come to terms but PG&E remains a balky holdout  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday,?February 24, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/24/M N184206.DTL  Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday he had reached an agreement with Southern  California Edison to put the state's financially ailing utilities back on  their feet - but Pacific Gas and Electric Co., crucial to any deal, remained  a holdout.  The key to the deal is state purchase of utility transmission lines, which  would help the companies pay off debt they piled up selling electricity for  less than it cost them. Edison will part with its lines for $2.76 billion,  Davis said.  But PG&E is reluctant to sell, and the governor said no deal will work  without PG&E.  In addition to agreeing to sell its transmission lines, Edison said it would  produce inexpensive power to sell to the state for the next 10 years.  At a news conference in Los Angeles, Davis said the agreement in principle  with Edison ""provides value to both sides. The utility gets the financial  wherewithal to go back into business and keep our lights on. We get  commensurate value in specific benefits, which provide us long-term power at  very cheap rates.""  Davis' framework for righting California's wobbly energy market, however,  hinges on a similar agreement with PG&E. Those familiar with the talks  involving the utility, based in San Francisco, said discussions are moving  ""very, very slowly.""  ""They are adamantly resistant to selling their transmission facilities,"" said  Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek.  Ron Low, a spokesman for PG&E, did not comment on Keeley's statement, but  after talks concluded Thursday, Low said the two sides were ""very far apart""  on some issues.  In a statement yesterday, PG&E Corporate Chairman Robert Glynn said the  ""discussions were an important milestone in the resolution of California's  energy crisis.""  ""Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we  believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer  and shareholder interests,"" Glynn said. ""We are confident that continued  discussions can achieve a resolution for our company.""  Davis said he made ""good"" progress with Sempra Energy, the parent company of  San Diego Gas & Electric, but only ""some"" progress with PG&E.  Davis ruled out a deal that does not include PG&E.  ""I don't believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without acquiring 60  percent of the transmission lines. That, in turn, requires us to have an  arrangement with PG&E,"" he said. The other 40 percent of the grid is owned by  municipal utilities.  Keeley said Davis is right to insist that PG&E be part of any deal.  ""I think the deal announced is a good first step, and will hopefully put  pressure on the other companies,"" Keeley said.  CRITICS CALL DEAL BAILOUT The purchase price set for Edison's transmission lines is 2.3 times the  system's book value. Although critics argue that represents a bailout,  supporters of the plan say the lines are worth far more than book value.  For example, the cost to replace all the utilities' transmission lines -- a  figure that probably would come into play during a possible bankruptcy -- is  estimated at $20 billion. If the state pays 2.3 times the book value for all  three utilities' systems, it will pay $7.2 billion total.  The agreement with Edison follows a framework Davis announced last week. In  exchange for the purchase of the lines, Edison also agreed to return $420  million that the utility had sent to its parent company, establish  conservation easements on 20,000 acres of watershed for 99 years and drop all  litigation against the state demanding the ability to immediately raise  rates.  Edison also agreed to continue to sell the power it produces to the state at  cost for another 10 years.  Edison said it still believed that it would have won its lawsuit to recover  costs through a rate increase. But Edison International Chairman John Bryson  said, ""This agreement is far preferable to perhaps years of protracted  litigation.""  NO RATE INCREASE Davis continued to insist that the deal would not require a rate increase,  although he has indicated that the rate increase adopted by the state Public  Utilities Commission last month -- which was supposed to last 90 days --  would stay in place.  Davis has been under pressure to meet deadlines he has imposed himself for  making progress in the energy crisis, which he said were designed to reassure  Wall Street. However, he also had a personal stake in making yesterday's  announcement, as he left immediately for a five-day trip to the East Coast.  Davis will spend four days at the National Governors Association in  Washington, D.C., and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors  Association, which he chairs.  Much of his time will be spent reassuring his fellow governors that the  crisis is under control, as well as meeting with President Bush and Energy  Secretary Spencer Abraham.  DAVIS ON 'MEET THE PRESS' Davis also will use the time to make national media appearances, including  one on ""Meet the Press"" tomorrow. Garry South, Davis' political strategist,  said the appearances will allow Davis to address some East Coast media  accounts of the energy crisis.  ""A lot of misconceptions and myths have crept in,"" South said. ""It's not  helpful to California; it's not accurate on how the crisis came about and how  we're trying to solve it.""  After he leaves Washington, Davis will spend a day in New York to meet with  Wall Street analysts. Yesterday, he suggested that he would be asking for  their support in California's quest for revenue bonds to help pay for power  purchases.  California will have spent $2.8 billion on power by next month, and its  credit ratings have been downgraded by some analysts.  Consumer advocates reacted with skepticism to Davis' tentative deal with  Edison.  Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, The Utility Reform Network, said she  was displeased with the governor's plan because it commits ratepayers to  paying off an unidentified portion of utility debt.  ""Nothing says what the final price tag is,"" she said.  Dealing for Power  -- Power lines: The state would buy Southern California Edison's transmission  lines for about $2.7 billion, 2.3 times their estimated book value, to help  bail out the financially strapped utility.  -- Helping out: Edison parent Edison International would pay the utility  about $420 million.  -- Payback: Edison would drop its lawsuit seeking higher electricity rates  and would to continue to sell the state cheap power for another 10 years.  -- The other shoe: ''Some progress'' reported in talks over a similar deal  with PG&E, which is reluctant to sell its lines.  Source: Associated Press  Other Developments  ENERGY FORECAST California enjoyed its second straight day without a power alert. Lori  O'Donley, spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator said  continued warm weather around the West and completion of maintenance on some  power plants that had been out of operation kept the state above the percent  reserve mark. O'Donley said the state should remain out of the danger zone  during the weekend.  MORE MEGAWATTS COMING Mirant Corp., announced that it signed a contract to provide 750 megawatts of  power to the state during the month of March. ""We became more confident in  our ability to enter such a contract after we received full payment from the  Department of Water Resources for a bill due Feb. 20,"" said Randy Harrison,  executive director of the company's western operations.  INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SETTLEMENT Three generators reached a settlement with the California Independent System  Operator to continue to supply emergency power to California until March 18  even though it is unclear who will pay for much of that power.  Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Cos. and Dynegy Inc. signed an agreement that  effectively extended a U.S. District Court judge's temporary restraining  order that had required the generators to supply power to the power grid  operators.  In the meantime, the three generators, along with Duke Energy Corp. and  Mirant Corp., have asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for an  emergency order forcing the Independent System Operator to provide a  creditworthy buyer for their power.  The federal commission on Feb. 14 told the system operator that it could not  force generators to take on ""unacceptable financial risks"" by selling without  a reasonable expectation of being paid.  CONSERVATION REWARD State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, said he will propose legislation to give $1  billion to customers who conserve on their electricity bills during the  summer months. Perata claims that his bill, which would pay consumers a $10  refund for every megawatt hour saved, would reduce the amount of money that  the state would have to spend buying power on the expensive spot market.

3293,"Pact With PG&E Eluding Governor  Power: Davis says obstacles include a debt that is double Edison's. Others  cite an aggressive corporate culture as an impediment to state purchase of  grid.  By DAN MORAIN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers   ?????WASHINGTON--As he attempts to finalize a settlement with Southern  California Edison, Gov. Gray Davis said Monday that his effort to rescue a  more recalcitrant Pacific Gas & Electric has been short-circuited by issues  far more difficult than those raised by the state's other two ailing  utilities.  ?????PG&E's debt could be as much as $8 billion, Davis indicated--twice the  red ink of Edison, which Friday reached a preliminary agreement to sell its  transmission lines to the state for $2.76 billion to pay off some of its  staggering debt. Davis acknowledged that the Edison deal would mean nothing  unless he was able to reach a twin pact with PG&E.  ?????Seasoned utility watchers see PG&E's stubborn negotiating posture as  partly a bargaining ploy and partly the result of underlying business issues  at the San Francisco company.  ?????Some cite a more aggressive corporate culture at PG&E than at Edison  that has left PG&E alone on a precarious pinnacle, with bankruptcy on one  side and partial dismembering by the state on the other.  ?????Brian Youngberg, senior utility analyst with the Edward Jones investment  firm in St. Louis, said PG&E ""has historically pushed the envelope more in  certain situations and that probably reflects their corporate culture.  They're just sticking to their guns.""  ?????While Edison appears to have rejected bankruptcy law protection as an  option, PG&E has not.  ?????Although Davis did not specify the size of PG&E's debt, he said it is  ""more than twice the size of Southern California Edison's."" As part of the  deal between Davis and Edison, both sides agreed that the utility's debt is  about $4 billion, sources close to the talks have said.  ?????""We are making progress"" with PG&E, said Davis, attending the annual  National Governors Assn. conference in Washington, D.C. ""I want people to  understand it is a far more complicated transaction. . . . It is just going  to take a little longer.""  ?????Officials at PG&E and its parent, PG&E Corp., declined to publicly  discuss the company's stance, citing the sensitivity of the negotiations.  Company spokesman Ron Low said only that ""we expect to meet again this week.  There was no time or date set yet.""  ?????San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, one of Davis' energy advisors, said  the parties ""had contact over the weekend"" but he declined to elaborate.  ?????""We in the governor's office would very much like to reach arrangements  with them and don't want to say anything in public that spoils the  negotiations,"" he said.  ?????PG&E's hard-nosed bargaining stance is no surprise to Wall Street  analysts and consumer advocates who have watched the utility's aggressive  moves to shed its hydroelectric system, now blocked by state law, and to  recoup past electricity and other costs.  ?????""It could be a negotiating tactic,"" said Lori Woodland, an analyst with  Fitch Inc., the credit-rating firm that was the first to drop PG&E and  Edison's debt to junk bond status.  ?????""PG&E has the largest piece of the pie"" in terms of uncollected  electricity costs, Woodland said. ""It could also be just the thought of  having to sacrifice their assets to pay for what ended up being flawed public  policy.""  ?????Consumer advocate Michael Shames contends that PG&E might believe that a  bankruptcy judge would allow the utility to sell some assets and restructure  its debt in ways that would be preferable to anything the state is offering.  ?????""On the other hand, if Edison and [San Diego Gas & Electric] do sign on,  then PG&E almost has to or risk the wrath of the governor and the Public  Utilities Commission for the next seven years,"" said Shames, executive  director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.  ?????Edison is more comfortable in the role of regulated utility than is  PG&E, said Mike Florio, a lawyer with the Utility Reform Network in San  Francisco.  ?????""PG&E really seems to hate PUC regulation and wants to get as far away  from it as it can, even if it means taking the company into the tank,"" said  Florio, who is on the governing board of the California Independent System  Operator, which runs the transmission grid owned by the three utilities.  ?????The utilities have amassed more than $12 billion in debt as they paid  record sums for wholesale power last year, but were barred by state  regulators from passing those costs on to California consumers of  electricity.  ?????The level of debt is a fundamental part of the negotiations between the  Davis administration and the three private utilities. At least part of that  debt ultimately will be passed on to consumers. While Davis says he opposes  rate hikes, his plan would restructure the rate system by propping up rates  in the coming years, even as electricity costs may fall.  ?????Davis on Friday announced the outlines of an accord in which the state  would buy Edison's share of the transmission grid for $2.76 billion. He said  he hopes to make the deal final by week's end with Edison and Sempra, the  parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric.  ?????Davis, meanwhile, is scheduled to meet today with U.S. Energy Secretary  Spencer Abraham to outline his plan to take over the transmission grid. The  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must approve the state takeover of the  grid, and FERC Chairman Kurt Hebert has been quoted recently as being  skeptical of the plan.  ?????""Some people in Washington see this as more of an ideological  statement,"" Davis said. ""As a governor, I see it as a practical solution. . .  . Clearly, we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what we're  doing is the right thing.""  ?????Davis expressed optimism that the Bush administration would approve the  transfer. Davis and other governors attending the conference met with the  president for about 45 minutes at the White House on Monday.  ?????In his opening remarks, Bush repeated his desire to give the states more  authority, saying ""real change comes from the states up.""  ?????Davis noted that he and other Western governors are hoping for federal  aid to overhaul the transmission and distribution systems for electricity and  natural gas system.  ?????""If we're going to have a strong economy,"" Davis said, ""we have to have  the electricity to power it.""  ?????Davis, chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., was scheduled to  attend a $5.5-million fund-raiser Monday night for the Democratic governors  in Washington. He will then leave for New York, where he will hold personal  fund-raisers and confer with Wall Street analysts Wednesday about the state's  energy situation.  ?????Meanwhile, Duke Energy North America on Monday suspended a lawsuit it  had filed against Davis. The company said it reached an ""interim settlement""  to sell power to the state at the same below-market prices that it originally  had agreed to supply to Edison and PG&E under long-term contracts.  ?????Duke sued the governor after he used emergency authority to seize the  Duke contracts and similar contracts signed by other energy companies with  the two utilities. Davis' action prevented the Power Exchange, the state's  now defunct electricity market, from liquidating the contracts after Edison  and PG&E defaulted on multimillion-dollar payments.  ?????The agreement reached Monday between Duke and the state expires April  30, a Duke spokesman said, which should give the parties enough time to reach  a more formal settlement.  ?????Power Exchange officials, however, are pressing ahead with their  $1-billion claim against the state. Under California law, the state must pay  reasonable value for private property seized under the governor's emergency  authority.  * * * ?????Morain reported from Washington, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.

3302,"Too hot a market: How energy producers manipulate California    (Published Sept. 22, 2000)  The priciest place to shop this August in California was in Pasadena. There  at the California Power Exchange, where much of the state's electricity is  bought and sold, prices that utilities paid for power (an average $166 per  megawatt) were up fivefold from the previous August ($32). What is happening?  Among other things, too much power on hot days is being purchased in the  near-panic environment that develops in the hours before a possible crisis.  Too little is being purchased as it should be -- days, or even months, in  advance.  How was this new market-based system of buying electricity supposed to work?  Much of the action was supposed to take place at the Power Exchange. There  vibrant trading was supposed to exist in a variety of markets. Some utilities  would be busy shopping for electricity the next day. Others, depending on  their needs, would be squirreling away supply a month, even a year, in  advance.  Selling this power are private companies that have been busy purchasing  fossil-fuel burning generators from the state's investor-owned utilities.  Under the state's restructuring of electricity, these utilities were  obligated to sell their fossil-fuel burning plants, but not necessarily their  nuclear or hydroelectric generators.  On any given day, up to 95 percent of the power needed to fuel California was  supposed to be already purchased. The idea was to leave just a little bit for  the last minute. Headquartered in Folsom, the state's entire grid is managed  by an agency known as the Independent System Operator. The ISO's job is to  buy whatever extra power is necessary to keep the lights on. With literally  only hours to work with, the ISO is ill-suited to drive hard bargains. The  ISO pays up to $250 per megawatt.  The problem is that the ISO's spot market is way too big, and too pricey. It  is buying up to 30 percent of California's power on some days, particularly  hot ones. This August, less power is being purchased in those struggling  futures market down in Pasadena. More was being bought in Folsom. This is a  telltale sign that California's electricity market is working for those who  own power plants, not those who pay the bills that are poised to rise.  ",dasovich-j

3314,"It's always darkest before the light (though it may not get light in our  lifetimes).  Looks great.  Couple of points:  1) Despite promises to the contrary--common theme in this exercise--Burton  (as I understand) did not remove the condemnation (expropriation?) language  from ABx6, i.e., the state can just take your power plant (or anything else,  it seems), if it has the inkling.  That's an egregious provision in ABx6.  2) I don't recall trying to amend ABx18 to say, ""pay them their PX credits.""   I understood the tactic to be--get a prospective, date certain end to the  freeze in the bill, which then gives us very firm legal ground on which to  seek and get the money owed to us.  We could seek the additional language,  but if putting date certain does the same thing without attracting a lot of  attention, may be a preferable path.  3) Forgive me if I've just overlooked it, but I got wind of a bill by Ms  Migden (ABx8?)  that gives one whole heckuvalot of new power--power usually  left to FERC--to the CA Electricity Oversight Board.  Anyone know about it?   We may want to get details for inclusion in the discussion with Delainey.    Best, Jeff",dasovich-j
3315,"To Jim's last point.  I understand that the good 'ol utility system was often  operated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there's  something in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seems  to always be tied to this notion that ""California is a net importer, even in  the winter.""  I'm going to start with the economics and then let folks  describe why it seemingly doesn't apply in Western electricity markets.  Just about every theory of economics and trade would lead to one conclusion:   If California closes it's doors the other Western states will pay higher  prices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I'm  struggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren't applicable  to Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex place  and that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that has  developed over the years.  To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I've confined the  analysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.  The basic situation: The PNW peaks in the winter; California peaks in the  summer.  Let's take two scenarios:  1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in its  peak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has so  overbuilt it's system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.  Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CA  to the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking. The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash in  electricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makes  economic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it must  be cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather than  produce itself.  Otherwise, it's difficult to understand why it would buy  from California during this month, particularly if they're long.  As such, at  a minimum, the PNW's electric bill will necessarily increase if California  closes its doors.  2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peaking  load.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California's power during its peaking  summer period, and California must buy power during it's summer peaking  period.  In this case, not only will the PNW's bill go up if California  closes its doors, the lights are likely to go because they'll be short power.  I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be other  legitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW  (e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may not  have traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might be  useful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for the  question that Jim asks.  With that, I'll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the model  set forth above):  Given that California sends power north--even if the PNW  is long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW's cost of  power?

3331,"The author is a very well-know Republican, Dan Schnur.   Needed - Star to Guide Us As Gov. Gray Davis gets the state deeper into the energy business, PUC chair  is no bright light  Dan Schnur Wednesday, February 28, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/28/E D102858.DTL  IN A DEAL that serves mainly to malign the good name of white elephants, Gray  Davis last week proposed to solve California's energy crisis by spending  several billion dollars of taxpayer money to purchase more than 30,000 miles  of transmission lines from the state's utilities.  In addition to offering to pay the privately owned utilities more than twice  the book value, Davis will put the state on the hook for more than a billion  dollars in desperately needed repairs to the transmission system. None of  which will do anything to keep the lights on this summer when temperatures  start to rise and the state's lack of power capacity leads to regular rolling  blackouts.  Davis' proposal also raises the question of which state employees will take  on this highly complex and technical challenge. Since assuming control of the  purchase of electricity from the utilities last month, state bureaucrats have  been folded, spindled and mutilated in their efforts to negotiate prices with  seasoned private sector professionals.  California is currently paying more than $50 million per day for electricity,  running up a bill that will exceed $2 billion by the end of February. Not  reassuring is the prospect of the same negotiators being entrusted with the  operation and upkeep of the power lines.  Facing re-election next year, Davis knows that any rate increase would be  political hemlock. So the governor's other primary objective would seem to be  identifying other words to describe the rate increases Californians will soon  pay.  Doing great damage to Capitol thesauruses, Davis has announced something he  calls a ""dedicated rate component."" The practical effect will be the  expiration of the temporary 10 percent rate reduction and a permanent 9  percent rate increase.  Translated into English from the original Davis-ese, the solution means most  Californians will soon pay almost 20 percent more for their electricity. The  billions of dollars in revenue bonds that Davis will issue have already been  double-promised, both to pay back state coffers for the electricity currently  being purchased and to subsidize the future cost of keeping the utilities  solvent. It's a good bet that the 20 percent increase is just the beginning.  Unfortunately, Davis' twin goals of spending billions of dollars to bail out  the utilities and avoiding rate hikes are mutually and utterly contradictory.  The reason that the utilities need saving in the first place is because the  state has forbidden them from charging market prices for electricity. And the  only way that the state can continue to offer artificially low rates is to  either raise taxes, eliminate other spending programs, or pretend to  subsidize the cost with the same bonds that have already been  double-committed.  Knowing that there's not nearly enough money available to allow Davis to keep  all of his promises, the utilities themselves have done an admirable job of  restraining their enthusiasm for the governor's proposal. Southern California  Edison's leaders, recognizing a gun to their head when they saw it, signed  onto the deal. PG&E seems ready to fight on, but they're not bargaining from  a position of great strength. Public opinion is already solidly against the  utilities, and it's not like they can start supplying power to Arizona if  they can't come to terms with Davis.  If the state is going to involve itself so deeply in the energy business,  Davis needs to find some qualified assistance. Unfortunately, he has instead  entrusted California's electricity future to a Democratic Party campaign  worker with virtually no experience in energy or power-related issues.  Just over a year ago, Davis appointed Loretta Lynch, a San Francisco trial  lawyer and longtime Democratic campaign aide, to fill a vacancy on the state  Public Utilities Commission. Less than 60 days after Lynch joined the  commission, Davis promoted her to the chairmanship.  Lynch prepared for her responsibilities through several years in state  Democratic politics, including stints as assistant campaign manager for state  Attorney General John Van de Kamp's unsuccessful campaign for governor in  1990,  as deputy campaign manager for Dianne Feinstein's successful U.S. Senate  campaign in 1992 and as campaign manager for Delaine Eastin's 1994 race for  state superintendent of public instruction. For good measure, Lynch worked  with aides to then-Gov. Bill Clinton in 1992 to squelch media investigations  into the earliest reports of the emerging Whitewater scandal. This is the  resume of someone whose only previous experience with electricity had been  turning on and off the lights at state Democratic Party headquarters.  Lynch's lack of experience and knowledge about energy has undoubtedly helped  turn a significant problem into a full-fledged disaster. California's  utilities spent months begging for permission and guidelines to sign  long-term agreements with suppliers that would have greatly reduced  electricity prices. Both the utilities and their suppliers say that Lynch and  her fellow commissioners turned a deaf ear. As late as December, Lynch was  still telling the news media that no emergency existed and that California  had all the electricity it needed. All things considered, Davis might as well  have named James Carville as commander of the California National Guard.  More than 20 years ago, then-California Gov. Jerry Brown appointed another  young campaign worker to a critically important position in his  administration.  Rose Bird, whose only prior legal experience was as a deputy public defender  in Santa Clara County, was named as Chief Justice of the state's Supreme  Court.  By the time California voters made her the first Supreme Court justice in the  state's history to be recalled from the bench, she had managed to overturn  more than 60 death sentences.  Until her death in 1999, Bird helped define an entire generation of  California politics and public safety debate. Ironically, one of the keys to  Davis' election as governor was his ability to distance himself from the  legacy of both Brown and Bird. But Davis may have repeated his former boss's  worst mistake when he named an equally inexperienced campaign staffer to lead  the state agency that is tasked with the responsibility for solving  California's electricity crisis.  There is still time for Davis to avoid punchline status. But he must  immediately replace Lynch with someone who possesses the experience and  expertise to help lead California through this critical time.  Davis, who is the most politically calibrated of governors, may already be  heading in this direction. Polls show that Californians disapprove of the job  the state PUC is doing by overwhelming margins. By the time voters learn that  it's the governor's job to oversee the PUC, Davis may decide that keeping a  political crony in such an important position is a luxury he can't afford.  Because the last thing he wants is to head into a re-election campaign being  forced to defend the Rose Bird of electricity.  Dan Schnur, longtime veteran of California politics, was communications  director for Republican presidential candidate John McCain and for former  Gov. Pete Wilson.  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Page A21 ",dasovich-j

3383,"FYI. *********************************************************************** UC Pioneers Conservation  Two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch  When the state's energy crisis hit, the University of California was not  caught with its fans running full blast.  Across the nine-campus UC system, $65 million has been spent over two decades  on energy-saving devices, including new lighting, variable speed fans, even a  system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers.  So, with Gov. Gray Davis calling for every California household and business  to cut electricity use by 10 percent, UC offers a good model of conservation.  Despite rapid growth in the 178,000-student system in recent years, most  campuses have held electricity consumption steady, and the university will  net about $75 million in savings from the projects.  ""We are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion. They have  been working on this agenda since the oil embargo,"" said Gary Matteson, UC  director of energy and utilities planning.  But UC will need to do more. Facing a 146 percent increase in the cost of  natural gas -- which powers the co-generators that produce electricity -- the  university is now asking the state for $217 million to fund additional  conservation efforts. That way, UC could offset the increase in natural gas  prices.  As a state institution, UC has to reduce its electricity consumption by 8  percent of its base load -- which is 334 megawatts at peak -- and by 20  percent during Stage 2 alerts, when state electricity reserves fall below 5  percent. UC has already exceeded the 8 percent reduction and Matteson said he  expects the system to be ready to meet the 20 percent goal by June 1, before  the summer peak hits.  Like little cities, the campuses run around the clock, but laboratory lights  that used to blaze continuously are now going dark when not needed, those in  hallways have been dimmed or shut off when possible and the thermostats have  been lowered.  ""I almost stumble through some of the hallways, it is so dark,"" said Keith  Roberts, energy engineer at UC Davis. ""There are a lot of people who really  want to help out. We are trying to do what we can without impacting the  mission of the campus.""  At many campuses, daily e-mail alerts remind students, as well as employees,  to open their window shades to light and warm their rooms and offices during  the day, and to shut off computers and lights when they are not in use.  At UC Berkeley, freshman Jon Clingan, 18, said signs have been posted in the  hallways and bathrooms of the residence halls, imploring students to save  electricity in their rooms and even to cut short their showers.  ""I try to keep my light off as long as possible until it is just not possible  to do work,"" Clingan said.  In addition to conserving energy, UC protected itself against skyrocketing  electricity prices by signing a four-year contract in 1998 -- along with the  California State University system -- with Enron Corp to buy electricity at  the 1996 rate minus 5 percent. In 1986, systemwide co-generation plants were  installed to produce sufficient energy for most university buildings and to  pump an additional 20 megawatts into the state's electricity grid.  That approach saved most of the UC campuses from falling victim during the  state's rolling blackouts -- although UC Santa Cruz went dark one day in  January because its co-generation plant was out.  MARKET PRICES AHEAD Still, UC officials are asking the Legislature for extra money, warning that  a systemwide natural gas bill is expected to rocket from $26 million last  year to a projected $64 million this year. A contract for low-priced gas is  expiring and UC will soon find itself paying market prices.  That means UC will face having to raise dormitory fees, cut back on night and  weekend classes and turn down the air conditioners in the summer, leaving  classrooms sweltering.  Saying that that would be unacceptable, Assemblywoman Elaine Alquist, D-  Santa Clara, chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee, called a  hearing on the issue last month.  ""I really wanted to hear how they were going to cope with the crisis,"" she  said.  UC is already negotiating with the State Department of Finance to get about  $217 million for an additional list of energy efficiency and conservation  projects that could save 149 megawatts within three years. Reducing  electricity means reducing reliance on natural gas.  John Baca, manager of the policy and strategic planning program for the  Office of Energy Assessments at the state Department of General Services,  said higher education facilities tend to consume a lot of energy.  ""They have experiments that just can't go off and they have a lot of flue  hoods, and things like that,"" Baca said. ""They have to have power for a lot  of different things all the time, so there is still a lot of potential at the  higher education level. But I think UC has done a really fantastic job.""  SYSTEMWIDE CHANGES The efforts have been made across the system.  UC Santa Cruz undertook an extensive conservation project that reduced  electricity consumption in academic and administrative buildings by 6  percent.  UC Davis has spent about $15 million on conservation renovations during the  past 10 years, saving at least $3 million a year.  At UC Berkeley, more than $6 million has been spent since 1986 to improve  energy efficiency on the campus by modifying and reducing light fixtures in  older buildings, installing centrally located automated controls that can run  heating and cooling equipment on a flexible schedule, and improving  efficiency around heating pipes.  ""Our usage is only 3 percent above what it was in 1972-73,"" said Paul Black,  a senior engineer in the UC Berkeley physical plant department. ""And if you  think of all the computers added and also the air conditioners we have added  to cool computer rooms and labs, that is good.""  E-mail Tanya Schevitz at  ",dasovich-j

Best, Jeff  Davis announces first round of long-term power contracts  DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer Monday, March 5, 2001  ,2001 Associated Press  (03-05) 12:31 PST SACRAMENTO (AP) -- The state has reached 40 long-sought  long-term contracts and other agreements to keep power flowing to customers  of two financially ailing utilities, Gov. Gray Davis announced Monday.  The deals will supply an average of nearly 8,900 megawatts per year for  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers over  the next 10 years and let the state buy power for far less than it has been  paying on the costly spot market, Davis said in a written statement.  One megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 households.  For the first five years, the contracts provide power at an average price of  $79 per megawatt hour, about 75 percent below recent costs on the spot  electricity market, Davis said.  The price drops to an average of $61 per megawatt hour, about 80 percent  below spot prices, he said.  ``These agreements are the bedrock of a long-term energy solution,'' Davis  said in remarks prepared for delivery Monday afternoon in Los Angeles. ``The  provide reliability at a reasonable price.''  Some of the contract negotiations will result in accelerated power plant  construction, adding an estimated 5,000 megawatts to the state grid within  the next two years, some by this summer, Davis said.  The contracts amount to 75 percent of the long-term deals the Davis  administration has sought under a new law that lets the state spend an  estimated $10 billion over a decade to buy power for Edison and PG&E  customers.  Davis has pitched such contracts as one way to lift California out of its  energy crisis. Negotiations have taken longer than expected, however, as his  administration and power providers haggled over how much the state should  pay.  The Davis administration wants to stop paying for power on the expensive spot  market, where desperation to keep the lights on leads to inflated prices.  On Friday, the state released another $500 million to continue making such  purchases on behalf of the state's two big cash-strapped utilities, bringing  its spending so far to some $3.2 billion since early January.  The agreements announced Monday include more than 20 power suppliers,  including electricity giants Duke Energy, Calpine, Dynegy, Enron and Reliant.  Davis declined to release details on individual contracts.  Duke Energy said it has reached a $4 billion, nine-year agreement to sell  electricity to the state.  The memorandum of understanding calls for Duke to provide 550 megawatts  starting next Jan. 1. That's enough power for roughly 550,000 households.  That amount would rise to 800 megawatts Jan. 1, 2003, enough electricity for  the equivalent of 800,000 households. The contract would continue through  2010.  ``We believe long-term contracts provide the critical underpinning for a  stable electricity market and are happy the state is moving in that  direction,'' Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said in a  written statement.  The state is buying about one-third of the power used by the customers of  Edison and PG&E. Both have been denied credit by suppliers who fear the  financially troubled utilities won't pay for the power.  California plans to recover those costs by issuing $10 billion in revenue  bonds in May, with the rest of that money going to finance the cheaper,  long-term power contracts.  In addition to the long-term contracts, the Department of Water Resources has  reached 11 agreements letting it buy a substantial amount of power on the  day-ahead market, cutting the state's payment of premium prices on the  real-time market, Davis said.  A Stage 1 power alert was called Monday morning with reserves threatening to  drop to 7 percent due to power plant maintenance and low electricity imports,  said Patrick Dorinson, spokesman for the Independent System Operator. The ISO  manages the state's power grid. ",dasovich-j

The utilities ""double dipping"" argument is off base.  As important, the state  is facing the threat of frequent and severe supply disruptions this summer  and it needs to take each and every step necessary to try to avoid them.

3453,"State's Outlays for Electricity May Be Hard to Recover Without a Rate Hike By REBECCA SMITH, MITCHEL BENSON and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER  Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Earlier this year, Gov. Gray Davis made what may be the  biggest bet in the history of the nation's biggest state: that he could tame  an out-of-control electricity market and avoid devastating blackouts without  busting the state's budget, antagonizing its consumers or derailing his own  political career.  His wager is still on the table, but the assumptions that underlie it are  looking increasingly shaky these days. The governor has already spent around  $2 billion of public money buying hugely expensive wholesale power, taking  over the role formerly played by the state's near-bankrupt electric  utilities. And California will probably be obliged to spend billions more  before its electricity market stabilizes and those utilities are restored to  some semblance of financial health. Under the governor's plan, California aims to recoup the money it is using to  buy electricity by issuing $10 billion in bonds. That way it would still have  a healthy budget surplus to finance new spending on roads, schools and other  public services. But there's a potentially big obstacle to this plan. The  state Legislature, worried about racking up billions in new debt, has put  limits on the size of any bond offering. In broad terms, the Legislature's  action would allow the state to borrow only four times as much as it can  recover annually from utility customers. Right now that doesn't appear to be much. Under the current rate structure,  essentially set in place by California's flawed 1996 electricity-deregulation  plan, consumers pay far less for power than the cost of acquiring it on the  wholesale market. Preliminary estimates submitted by utilities last month to  the California Public Utilities Commission show the state's share of the  proceeds from electricity sales this year could be as little as $241 million  -- not enough to support even $1 billion in bond sales under the  Legislature's formula.  That would leave the state on the hook for much of the money it has already  paid for power -- not to mention the billions more Gov. Davis will need to  spend. That, in turn, raises the prospect that California's economy and its  credit rating both could deteriorate significantly. But state finance  officials say that, based on their own projections, they will be able to  extract enough money to support a $10 billion bond issue. Walking a careful line between fiscal prudence and political survival, Mr.  Davis and others in his administration are scrambling to come up with ways to  get around the legislative restrictions without raising rates for consumers.    treatment, says Karen  Johanson, a former ISO board member. One of the first acts of the ISO's new board was to close a meeting about the  electricity crisis. The former ISO board routinely held such meetings in  public. ISO attorneys say the meeting was largely designed as a private  briefing for new board members and that the organization is committed to  keeping its deliberations as open as possible. The Wall Street Journal and  other news organizations have unsuccessfully challenged the closure in  Sacramento state court. Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca. ",dasovich-j

3476,"Soaring Electric Use More Fiction Than Fact  Chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their  towering rates Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday, March 11, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/11/M N213155.DTL   Power companies say it so often, and with such certainty, that it has become  a virtual mantra: ""Skyrocketing"" energy use by Californians is a root cause  of the state's power crisis, and justification for surging electricity  prices.  But a computer analysis of electricity usage data by The Chronicle reveals  that the mantra is a myth -- that overall growth in electricity demand hasn't  been nearly as great as the industry portrays it.  The industry has painted the summer of 2000 as the equivalent of a 100-year  storm in meteorology -- an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing  infrastructure was devastated by its force.  The statistics show that 2000, taken in total, was nothing of the sort.  Moreover, two independent state agencies' assessments of California's power  plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily  accommodated.  The companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power-  generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent  plant usage necessitated major, time-consuming repairs.  ""The claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected  and due to the Internet economy, to Silicon Valley, or server farms,  or people recharging cell phones -- that's bogus,"" said Tom Kelly, assistant  executive director of the California Energy Commission. ""About as bogus as  you can get.""  The Chronicle's findings are based on data collected by the California  Independent System Operator, a manager of the state's electricity grid. They  show:  -- Total electricity consumption in California increased only 4.75 percent in  2000 from 1999, a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives, who  have repeatedly relied on isolated, loose or selective comparisons that make  growth appear as high as 20 percent. In fact, the single greatest hour of  electricity usage in 2000 was actually lower than any peak demand period in  1999 or 1998.  -- Average peak demand -- the average of the highest hour of electricity  usage for each day -- increased only 4.79 percent from 1999 to 2000. Even  during the months of May to September in 2000, when the greatest spikes in  electricity usage occur, demand growth was only 8.31 percent higher than the  same period the year before.  -- More than 30 days of critical power shortage warnings, so-called Stage 3  emergencies, and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of  moderate energy use -- levels often below those at which neither warnings nor  blackouts have occurred in the past.  The findings appear to buttress suspicions that the ""skyrocketing demand""  explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening  --  that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential  commodity, regardless of whether it is in short supply.  Presented with The Chronicle's findings, Gary Ackerman, a representative for  the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade group representing power companies,  said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand  is growing strong.  ""That's pretty healthy growth for California as opposed to the long-term  historical average, which is close to 2 percent,"" he said. ""To me, that's  really strong growth.""  Energy demand is certainly on the rise in California -- growth of more than 4  percent is still double what was projected -- and the state has obviously  fallen behind in building power plants.  Even though a recent study found California ranked 47th out of the 50 states  in per-capita energy consumption, the surging demand explanation has become  so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel. Gov. Gray Davis has  made energy conservation -- 10 percent, at that -- a centerpiece of his  efforts to solve the crisis.  ""Energy use is growing,"" said state Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, citing  the growth of Silicon Valley and high-tech operations statewide. ""There's  been tremendous growth, whether manufacturing or high tech -- cell phones,  faxes, whatever. The stuff is growing.""  Yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the  consumer is largely to blame. In testimony and submissions to government  bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis, energy demand growth has  consistently been overstated.  Joe Bob Perkins, the chief operating officer of Houston-based Reliant Energy  Inc., told the U.S. Senate in January that California's growing economy and  high summer temperatures caused electricity use to ""surge dramatically"" -- a  demand growth of 13 percent.  Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, said Perkins' testimony was based  on estimates by the federal Energy Information Administration of monthly  retail electricity sales.  ""We do stand by that,"" Wheatley said. ""Unfortunately, it does not track with  ISO data.""  The industry-backed Edison Electric Institute said in a report that  electricity demand grew by anywhere from 5 percent to 21 percent during the  spring of 2000, compared with the same period a year earlier.  Russell Tucker, an economist for the institute, said the group's figures were  derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each  spring month of 1999 and 2000 and comparing them, finding the May peak rose  21 percent.  Granted, the state Energy Commission uses the same model to determine whether  California has enough plant capacity to meet demand. But the presentation  makes it appear that overall demand, not just the absolute peak, is growing  by 21 percent. When the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year  to year, May's figure was much lower: 12.79 percent.  Also, nowhere did Edison's report note that the peak hour of 2000, a load of  43,784 megawatts on Aug. 16, was actually lower than the peak hours of either  of the previous two years -- 45,884 on July 12, 1999, or 44,406 on Sept.  1, 1998.  The Chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year  grew more than June's 15.34 percent, though no blackouts occurred in that  month. May and June were the only months when demand growth exceeded 10  percent, the analysis showed. Most months recorded 4 percent or 5 percent,  and some -- such as September -- were less than 3 percent.  Two months, October and December, had demand levels lower than the year  before -- 4.22 percent less for October, 1.46 percent lower for December.  Mike Florio, a consumer lawyer and board member of the ISO, said that even  growth of less than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000 would seem overstated, since  1999 was a relatively mild weather year and 2000 was a much hotter one. ""You  are quite right,"" Florio said. "" 'Skyrocketing' demand is a myth.""  MARKET MANIPULATION? Consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that,  rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand, market manipulation is  behind the crisis.  Generators and power marketers adamantly deny this, saying they have done  everything they could to keep the lights on. They say they ran aging,  decrepit plants at higher-than-normal levels last summer to accommodate what  they described as unprecedented demand. They also say that, at great expense,  they delayed much-needed maintenance in order to keep the power flowing.  Their claims have received some support from the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission, which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power  companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply. The report,  however, was heavily qualified by the FERC, which said it did not investigate  other forms of manipulation. Moreover, the agency acknowledged that the bulk  of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and  questioning them over the telephone.  The supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate, in part  because supply data are confidential. Thus, the question of how blackouts  could have occurred at such low levels of demand in January is hard to  answer. What is clear is that, at times, during the crisis this year, as much  as 12, 000 megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use,  mostly because of unplanned plant outages -- about four times the level  anticipated by the ISO.  Power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing  to the levels sketched out by the ISO and the Energy Commission, and that  everything from low water conditions, emissions limitations and high  temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was  anticipated.  But others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of  supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of  fear of not being paid.  What did go up, unquestionably, were wholesale electricity prices.  While average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased  by less than 5 percent, prices charged by power companies to the utilities  that deliver juice to consumers increased more than 289 percent.  In June, the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold, going from  the 1999 level of $30.53 to $170.60. In October, prices doubled over the same  period a year earlier, going from $53.47 to $111.04. And in December --  despite a 1.46 percent decline in electricity usage from the previous  December -- peak wholesale electricity prices hit $425.59. They'd been $31.88  one year before.  Then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six  months of 2000. Overall, average peak usage during December was about 31,200  megawatts, about a fifth lower than it was in August. Average prices in  December? They just about doubled, to $425 a megawatt hour.  The companies' explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that  more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs, decreasing supply.  Even given the high number of inoperable plants, questions remain about why  the existing supply could not cover demand.  On the blackout days of Jan. 17 and 18 fewer plants were offline -- and more  electricity was available -- than on days when the state managed to squeeze  by without turning out the lights.  Even today, with Stage 3 alerts having faded away, at least temporarily,  demand levels remain more or less the same as when California was in a  constant state of emergency. Moreover, the lists of offline plants are as  long as ever.  AMPLE POWER SHOULD EXIST The Energy Commission and the ISO have concluded that California's power  plants are capable of generating more than 45,000 megawatts of electricity.  That means that even with plant repair outages, low water levels decreasing  hydraulic generation, air-pollution rules and other environmental  constraints, the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the  most extreme spikes in demand.  According to industry data obtained by The Chronicle, the Western Systems  Coordinating Council, a government-backed trade group in Salt Lake City,  concluded California would have considerable surpluses throughout 2000,  including margins as high as 39 percent in December, based on data provided  to it by the ISO. Even under low water conditions, the ISO reported, the  state would have total power resources of 47,532 megawatts in that month. Yet  unplanned outages were far higher, and the system began to crash that month  and into this year, at far lower levels of demand.  ""Clearly,"" Florio said, ""we should not be having a shortage at 2 a.m. on  Christmas Eve, when the only person awake is Santa Claus.""

3478,"State PUC Takes On High Cost Of Energy  Regulators foresee more rate increases  Robert Salladay, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Monday, March 12, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/12/M N227831.DTL  Sacramento -- Starting this week, state regulators will begin debating how  much is enough when it comes to asking Californians to shoulder the  electricity crisis by paying higher utility rates.  Right now, there doesn't appear to be enough money to go around. The state  government and the utilities have racked up monumental bills because of  California's flawed deregulation system. And even with recent rate increases,  not enough cash is coming in to pay off the debts and buy power.  Over the next three weeks, deciding how that money gets divvied up to pay the  state's debt will be one of the toughest jobs of the year. State Treasurer  Philip Angelides said the state Public Utilities Commission would be  essentially filling a shoe box with debts and commitments during a series of  meetings and workshops this month, and it's going to be a tight fit without  raising power bills even more.  ""The rubber hits the road in the next few weeks at the PUC,"" Angelides said.  ""There is a box that has to be filled up, and a no-rate-increase scenario is  putting all of these things into this box. It'll be tough work.""  Under the law, the PUC has the power to essentially determine how much profit  the utilities can make. It's a set formula, designed to give the power  companies a comfortable margin and to keep power bills reasonable for  consumers.  But with the 1996 deregulation an utter failure in California, there are many  more demands on that money. The utilities claim to be $14 billion in debt.  The state of California is spending $45 million a day to buy power. Taxpayers  have spent $3.2 billion so far, and the PUC recently said utility customers  would be required to pay that money back.  Then there is the $10 billion in bonds the state is selling to buy long- term  contracts for power. Angelides said the PUC also must guarantee him an  estimated $1.3 billion a year from consumers to pay off the bonds, which his  office expects to begin selling by the end of May.  That money could end up running out by September, or June 2002 under the most  optimistic prediction, Angelides said. That could mean California would have  to borrow even more money beyond the $10 billion -- money that consumers will  most likely have to pay back through their bills.  Gov. Gray Davis has said repeatedly that it is his ""hope and expectation""  that rates will not increase. But he has been criticized for seeming to say  that a temporary rate increase approved in January will be made permanent and  that a 10 percent rate decrease imposed when deregulation was implemented  will be lifted next year.     Danforth said.  Paying the Bill  Most of what PG&E customers pay for electricity is spoken for but the demands  are about to get a lot bigger. .  Breakdown of contributors to electricity production  PG&E generated power -- What the utility produces at its own plants.  Alternative energy -- Electricity generated by solar, wind and biomass  companies.  Independent generators -- Power produced at non-PG&E plants in California and  elsewhere. .  PG&E customers currently pay 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour  Combined sources of electricity cost 6.134 cents per kilowatt hour  This portion represents 0.366 cents of leftover money .  Claims on leftover money  -- Money owed to the Independent System Operator, which has been forced to  buy electricity at very high prices in recent months.  -- Money owed to the alternative energy providers. Many of these small units  have stopped operating because they have not been paid.  -- Emergency power purchases likely to be necessary this summer, since the  state has not secured enough long-term contracts to provide all the power it  needs. That could drain either the state's coffers, or be paid for by  consumers. .  Source: Chronicle research Chronicle Graphic  E-mail the reporters at  ",dasovich-j
3479,"Feds Hint at Power Bill Refunds  Firms ordered to justify high rates  David Lazarus and Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers Saturday, March 10, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/10/M N144141.DTL  Federal regulators warned power companies yesterday that they may have to  refund $69 million to California ratepayers for charging unreasonable prices  during recent electricity shortages.  However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission left the door wide open for  the unnamed 13 generators to avoid refund payments if they could offer  ""further justification"" for why their rates should be considered fair.  Consumer activists were quick to note that the commission's order was  significant.  ""They have acknowledged for the first time that there has been abuse of the  marketplace,"" said Doug Heller, assistant organizing director for the  Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""It's an  acknowledgment that the power companies have been ripping us off.""  However, consumer groups also pointed out that the order -- issued late in  the day -- was partly a political ploy intended to make the Bush  administration look more sympathetic to California's plight.  The proposed $69 million refund also represents only a fraction of the  billions of dollars that utilities have had to pay due to rising electricity  rates.  The commission set narrow parameters for power charges in January that may be  considered unreasonable. It is only considering charges above $273 per  megawatt hour during the series of Stage 3 energy emergencies that threatened  statewide blackouts.  William Massey, the lone commissioner who voted against the order, noted that  of 70,300 power transactions in January above $150 per megawatt hour, only  about 13,000 fall within the regulatory commission's parameters for potential  refunds.  ""This order is arbitrary, capricious and unlawful,"" he said. ""Eighty percent  of the transactions have been excluded from refunds.""  But commission Chairman Curt Hebert characterized the order as an aggressive  effort to safeguard California consumers.  ""Today's refund order demonstrates the commission's commitment to ensure  appropriate and reasonable prices in the wholesale electricity market given  the supply and demand imbalance in California,"" he said in a statement.  POWER COMPANIES NOT WORRIED Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an  energy-industry association in Menlo Park, said power companies are not  worried about the prospect of having to pay out millions of dollars in  refunds.  ""The people I've talked to said they can justify the costs for a majority of  hours where FERC said there may have been overcharges,"" he said.  ""We will be supplying supporting data to FERC,"" said Richard Wheatley, a  spokesman for Reliant Energy in Houston. ""We commend them for doing this  review. We believe this can be resolved and we can all move on.""  Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade  group representing out-of-state generators, said the commission's order shows  that the system is working.  ""In my opinion, what has been identified is talking about potential refunds,  "" he said. ""The generators will have a chance to justify their rates. I'm not  terribly troubled by that.""  The California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power  grid, welcomed the order, although it said $69 million is lower than its own  estimates of potential overcharges.  The ISO had asked the commission earlier this month to review $350 million in  January power charges that exceeded the regulatory commission's ""soft cap"" of  $150 per megawatt hour.  A soft cap means the price can exceed the prescribed amount as long as a  supplier can justify the charge.  REFUND ORDERS ARE RARE ""The granting of refunds by FERC is not a common occurrence,"" said Charles  Robinson, the ISO's general counsel. ""We're treading new ground.""  Considering the potential ramifications of the order, the commission was  oddly furtive in issuing its press release at the very end of the business  week.  The commission's press office already was closed by the time of the  announcement, and the commissioners had left for the day.  Reached at his home, Massey acknowledged that the commission was all but  inviting power companies to bury the commission in paperwork to support their  wholesale rates.  ""Welcome to the Hebert chairmanship,"" he said.  Hebert was appointed head of the commission last month by President Bush.  Since then, the regulatory commission and the Bush administration have  maintained a largely hands-off approach to California's energy crisis.  ""We have said from the beginning that obviously the state of California has  to address these problems and these challenges,"" U.S. Energy Secretary  Spencer Abraham said this week.

3481,"PUC SET TO MAKE KEY RULING ON UTILITY BILLS;  ELECTRICITY: REGULATORS ARE ABOUT TO DECIDE HOW TO SPLIT PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND UTILITIES. THE FORMULA COULD AFFECT FURTHER RATE HIKES.  BYLINE: RONE TEMPEST, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF    DATELINE: SACRAMENTO  BODY:   ??How much of utility customers' monthly bills will be used to pay for California's multibillion-dollar entry into the power market?  ??That's the question as regulators set out in coming days to determine how to split ratepayers' bills between the state, which has been buying electricity  at the rate of $ 45 million a day since late January, and the debt-laden  utilities, which continue to deliver that power and collect customers' payments.  ??The issue has moved center stage as Gov. Gray Davis continues to negotiate a rescue of the near-bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern  California  Edison. The resolution is crucial to Davis' complex plan to pull California  out of its costly energy crisis.  ??When the Legislature put the state in the power-buying business, it needed  to ensure eventual reimbursement for its purchases. The result was the CPA, for California Procurement Adjustment, essentially the portion of customers' bills left over after the utilities subtract their cost of operations.  ??After weeks of wrangling in Sacramento, the front lines in the utility  debate will now shift for a time to San Francisco, where the California Public Utilities Commission will determine the size of the CPA and the way it is to  be divvied up.  ??How the commission rules will be the main factor in determining if customers of the three big investor-owned utilities--PG&E, Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric--will face rate hikes above the 19% already set in motion. It also  will have a direct bearing on the state's ability to sell the $ 10 billion in bonds it needs to finance its long-term power buys without having to commit taxpayer money.  ??""What happens at the PUC is fundamental, in terms of our ability to issue bonds with investment-grade ratings,"" state Treasurer Phil Angelides said.  ""How they allocate moneys between the state and utilities will be fundamentally important to how far our $ 10 billion will go. And it will be fundamentally important if it is not done in the right way, because it will have a direct  and negative impact on consumer rates.""  ??Utility executives disagree with the state on how to allocate the CPA but agree on its importance.  ??""One issue is: How do you divide the pie? And an important and related issue is: Is the pie big enough?"" said Ted Craver, chief financial officer of  utility parent Edison International, during a conference call Friday with debt  holders.  ??Before skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices turned PG&E and Edison into financial basket cases, the money left over after subtracting their costs of delivering power to customers was called ""headroom,"" and that was where the utilities paid off past investments, retired debt and took their profits.  ??Under Davis' plan, most such money would be reserved by the state to pay off the $ 10 billion in bonds to buy electricity and reimburse the treasury for  the billions the state has already spent to buy power.  ??Some consider this a gamble and wonder if there will be enough money available without either dipping into the state general fund or, more likely, raising customer rates even further.  ??Under the January law, AB 1X, that put California in the power-buying business, the CPA needs to total at least $ 2.5 billion annually from utility customers. Angelides on Thursday estimated that the state needs $ 1.3 billion from CPA funds just to service the bonds.  ??PG&E and Edison both say they believe the utilities are entitled to be paid first out of ratepayer bills under AB 1X.  ??The Department of Water Resources, the agency empowered by the state to buy electricity for utility customers, would get whatever is left over after  utility expenses are covered, the two companies say. If nothing is left, rates would  be allowed to rise high enough to pay the water agency what it needs to cover its electricity expenses under an interim order issued Wednesday by the PUC.  ??""If that means rate increases, then the commission has affirmed it will pass through those rate increases,"" said Ann Cohn, assistant general counsel for Southern California Edison.     ??*  ??Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story.

3482,"Greetings Mark:  Here is the latest.    ENA signed a short-term deal (5 -week term, I believe) with DWR that goes  through the end of the month, at which time we have the option to extend the  deal to a five-year term.  We are discussing other longer-term deals, too.  As Steve points out, we've had serious concerns regarding DWR's  creditworthiness.  (DWR, the Dept. of Water Resources, is the state agency  that Davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial  skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power.)  The problem has been simple and significant---while our brilliant Governor  and Legislature gave DWR the authority to buy power on behalf of the  cash-strapped utilities, they neglected to t spell out how DWR would recover  its costs of buying the power.  Based on comments from us and other suppliers regarding the creditworthiness  issue, the California PUC issued an order last week establishing that 1) the  PUC would indeed pass DWR's power costs through to ratepayers and 2) the PUC  would NOT second-guess (i.e., impose ""reasonabless"" standards) on any  contracts signed by DWR as a condition of passing the costs through to  ratepayers.  With the CPUC decision (and other language that ENA's negotiated into the DWR  contract), ENA is close to being comfortable signing the 5-year deal, even in  the face of the FERC order.  That's predominantly due to the fact that the  power price in the 5-year deal would come in well under the $150/MWH  threshold that FERC has set up for any sort of ""refund review.""  But other  things could crop up between now and the exercise date that could muck things  up. I'll keep you posted on developments  as they transpire.    The big problem (as Steve notes) is that the State is on the verge of (some  say hell bent on) taking over the entire electricity industry in California  in perpetuity.  Our original proposal focused on getting price volatility and  the utilities' financial position back under control.  Our contracting  proposals have always been couched in the context of a temporary, stop-gap  measure.  That is, the state would do the minimum amount needed via contracts  to stabilize prices while simultaneoulsly doing what was necessary to get  de-regulation back on track in California.  And once the situation had been  righted, the State would as soon as possible exit the industry and let the  market step back in.  Unfortunately, command-and-control, anti-deregulation  policymakers have taken hold of the agenda (with the blessing, seemingly, of  the Governor), and are moving the state toward a ""takeover"" response.  That's  what we're actively opposing.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff ",dasovich-j

3588,"Hi Katie: Thought IEP folks might be interested. Best, Jeff  Wednesday March 14, 12:22 pm Eastern Time  US Senate rejects California utility bankruptcy measure By Patrick Connole  WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday rejected a bid  to force California utility companies to repay power generators for  electricity they bought under a federal government sales order, even if  utilities go bankrupt.  In a motion on the Senate floor, lawmakers killed an amendment to a broader  bankruptcy reform bill that opponents said was a dangerous proposal that  would have opened the door to involuntary bankruptcy filings by troubled  California utilities. The utilities in question are PG&E Corp.'s (NYSE:PCG -  news) Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's (NYSE:EIX - news)  Southern California Edison.  The amendment was sponsored by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden, Montana  Democrat Sen. Max Baucus and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith.  Proponents said the measure would have protected the customers of the  federally-owned Bonneville Power Administration and other Northwest utilities  from unfair rate increases due to the California energy crisis.  ``I don't think it's fair for consumers in other Western states to get caught  holding the bag if California utilities take our power and then run into  bankruptcy court to avoid their debts,'' Wyden said.  ``The Northwest has been more than a good neighbor to California during this  crisis,'' he said.  Interestingly, the California Senate delegation was split on the matter.  Democrat Dianne Feinstein opposed the amendment, while fellow Democrat  Barbara Boxer supported it.  Feinstein called the proposal a ``dangerous amendment'' that would create two  classes of creditors and ``probably force an involuntary bankruptcy.''  The broader bankruptcy reform bill is expected to be approved by the Senate  by the end of the week.  Separately, talks between California and its three investor owned utilities  on a deal under which the state might buy their transmission assets continued  this week with no deal in sight.  The state is negotiating with PG&E and Edison, along with Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric.  The deals are aimed mainly at pumping money into PG&E and SoCal Edison to  keep them out of bankruptcy after they recorded about $13 billion in red ink  since last spring, paying sky-high prices for power in the wholesale market.  PG&E and SoCal Edison, under the terms of the state's disastrous experiment  with market deregulation, have been able to pass on to their retail customers  only a fraction of their power purchase costs.

3598,"Nokia Expects to Meet Earnings Forecast Despite Lowered Sales, Industry Outlook Dow Jones Newswires HELSINKI, Finland -- Despite market conditions that have cut into its sales  growth, Nokia Corp. said Thursday that it expects to meet its earnings target  for the first quarter of 2001, thanks to better-than-anticipated profit  margins. Nokia estimates it is likely to earn 19 European cents a share in the first  quarter, in line with estimates it provided in January. Nokia's shares received a boost from the statement, rising 2.60 euros, or  11%, to 27.15 euros in early-afternoon trading in Helsinki. In midday trading  in the U.S., shares of Nokia were up $3.20, or 15%, to $25 on the New York  Stock Exchange. The company said it expects year-on-year sales growth in its networks  division during the first quarter to be 30% to 35%, and 15% to 20% in the  mobile-handsets division. Total sales growth is expected to be around 20%,  the company said. That is lower than the 25% to 30% sales growth the company forecast in  January, when it released full-year results for 2000. The company said it has  had to confront ""difficult market conditions,"" particularly in the U.S. ""We feel confident about our strengths and our performance during the early  months of the year,"" Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Jorma Ollila said.  ""Despite the more difficult market conditions, we have been able to show good  progress. We expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole,  with better-than-anticipated margins."" As a result of the tougher conditions, Nokia said it now expects global  handset sales for 2001 to be between 450 million and 500 million units. It  had previously forecast a range of 500 million to 550 million units, saying  sales near the bottom end were more likely.  1Motorola Announces More Job Cuts In Wireless-Phone Handset Business (March  14) 2Ericsson Issues Profit Warning Amid Sagging Economy, Sales (March 13) 3Ericsson to Outsource Handset Sector to Stem Losses in Consumer Goods (Jan.  29)  Just last year, manufacturers were expected to sell about 650 million  cellphones world-wide in 2001, but the industry is slumping as many consumers  delay buying or upgrading their phones. Nokia's statement comes three days after Swedish rival Telefon AB L.M.  Ericsson warned that it expected a substantial loss in the first quarter  because of slowdowns in both its handset and networks businesses. And Motorola Inc. of the U.S. said Tuesday that it will slash 7,000 jobs in  its cellphone- and pager-manufacturing business, and will take a  still-unspecified charge against first- and second-quarter earnings. Including the latest cuts, Motorola has set plans to eliminate 18,000 jobs  since December, or 12% of its 147,000-member work force. Ericsson, meanwhile, has taken the unusual step of deciding to outsource its  entire phone production to a third party -- a major retreat by a company once  famous for manufacturing the most-sophisticated cellular phones in the world. Nokia said it has reacted to the changing market conditions by accelerating  programs to improve efficiency and cut costs, but it didn't provide details. The company also said it has widened its market share in the handset market  above the 32% it achieved in 2000. And it said its own stock levels, as well  as the stock levels of Nokia phones already shipped to stores, are lower than  at the end of 2000. ""More challenging times like these test your mettle as a company,"" Mr. Ollila  said. ""We believe that truly great companies emerge from challenging times  much stronger."" The company said it would comment further on its performance on April 20,  when it releases first-quarter results.

3609,"Greetings:   Recall that about 3 weeks we got a call from a CA PUC staffer asking whether  we'd switched a particular gas customer (or two) back to the LDC.  We looked  into it and discovered that we'd mistakenly switched the customer back due to  a mix up about the fact that the customer had two active meters behind two  different utilities.  We informed the PUC staffer of the mix-up and explained  that the situation would be resolved.    The questions from the staffer arose because the CA PUC made a bad decision a  couple of months ago. When gas prices ran up at the California border a lot  of large (""noncore"") customers attempted to switch back to the utility tariff  in the hope of lowering gas costs.  In response, SoCalGas filed with the  Commission asking the PUC to prohibit customers from switching back.  The  Commission agreed and put the prohibition in place.  The Commission is now  concerned that if suppliers terminate their contracts with customers (for  whatever reason), or choose not to renew the contracts when they expire,  customers won't have the option of returning to LDC service.  Today, I received a letter from the President of the Commission asking me to  respond to the following:  Have you ""stopped selling and delivering natural gas to any non-core  customers with whom you have an existing procurement contract, or...notified  any of your non-core customers that you do not intend to renew an existing  natural gas commodity procurement contract.  If your company has stopped or  intends to stop serving non-core customers, the CPUC also needs to know  how many contracts you have terminated or expect to terminate the natural gas volumes involved the location of the non-core customer(s) the reason(s) your company intends or has already acted to terminate those  contracts.""  There's a good chance that the letter from the President of the Commission is  linked to the fact that we've recently switched our electricity customers  back to utility service in California.    Prior to deciding whether and how to respond to the Commissioner, I'm trying  to get handle on whether we're re-sourcing any gas retail customers to the  utility prior to expiration, choosing not to renew contracts once they've  expired, etc.  Catherine, or Jim Foster, can you help out?

3618,"Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on the participants  list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where  markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.    That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about  what the goal of this ""study"" would be, which will determine, to a large  degree, whether we choose to pursue it.    I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to  serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate  ""To de-regulate or not.""  As such, I wouldn't see issues like ""PJM or APX"" or  ""competitive default supplier or not,"" or ""divest generation with vesting  contracts or retain the assets"" being the focus.    That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to  come in ""Round 2,"" once the initial debate over ""deregulate or not"" is won.   To try to do both, i.e., resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case  for the specific, ""right"" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study  down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the  current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is  won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of  course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on ""how to do  it,"" but that would not be the emphasis.  In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to  proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high  level policy level question of ""to deregulate or not,"" and address  implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to  make a call on this swiftly, since the ""go/no go"" decision would seem to flow  from resolution of this issue.  Best, Jeff    	James D Steffes 	 ",dasovich-j

3621,"State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected  Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests  Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying  electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential  document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle.  State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging  $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers  figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests.  The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources,  which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of  lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom  Hannigan.  To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much  California is spending on power purchases.  Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed,  it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw  it.  ""I don't think it was a surprise,"" said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R-  Redding.  Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity,  analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could  jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term.  For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education  programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst  warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in  Davis' proposed budget.  Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit  rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the  utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a  credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans  to rise.  ""This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect,"" said Jean Ross, executive  director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that  tracks state spending. ""Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the  energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look  like in the future.""  The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent  nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest  day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per  megawatt hour.  Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison &  Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices.  ""That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time,"" he  said. ""Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be.""  The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the  state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if  generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could  force up the price the next day.  But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right  to know how its money way being spent.  ""People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on,"" he  said. ""We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces.""  Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have  filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state  has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by  Davis.  The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated  only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if  needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has  sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional  money was needed.  Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5  billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending  $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water  Resources document.  Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has  become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a  house of cards.  The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is  supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds. The bonds will  be paid for with a portion of the rates that utility customers pay every  month.  -  Tell Us What You Think Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.  Gray Davis is offering rebates for Californians who save on power starting in  June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The Chronicle wants to  hear it.

Note Abraham's quote in p.#3 re: ""must increase supply or decrease  demand.""  I've heard that somewhere before.  Best, Jeff   Energy Boss Says State Summer Blackouts 'Appear Inevitable'  Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/16/MN20 0965.DTL  Washington -- The Bush administration warned yesterday that blackouts ""appear  inevitable"" in California this summer, but it firmly rebuffed a deal from  Sen. Dianne Feinstein that would force the state to lift its rate freeze on  consumers in exchange for federal controls on wholesale prices.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham insisted that price controls would make  shortages worse by reducing power sales into the state. The administration's  top priority is to prevent blackouts, he said.  ""Let me make one point clear,"" Abraham told the Senate Energy and Natural  Resources Committee. ""Any action we take must either help increase supply or  reduce demand. . . . Price caps will not increase supply or reduce demand. In  fact, in our view, they will seriously aggravate the supply crisis.""  Abraham said electricity shortages in California ""will get worse, and  blackouts this summer appear inevitable."" He cited projections of anywhere  from 20 to 200 hours of rolling outages this summer.  ""I'm not saying that people in California don't want lower energy costs,"" he  said.

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the  resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities  Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator  will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis.""  	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a  letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican  Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation.  	 	 	? 	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of  unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to  ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public  Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said.  	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment.  	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in  March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating  utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies.  Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of  Planning and Research.  	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the  electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison  International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp.  (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news,  msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts  for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term  contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators.  	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency  order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state  budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This  hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of  dollars during the next 20 years.""  	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the  spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the  general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the  state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion.  	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate  Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves  out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the  agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the  cash-strapped utilities.  	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can  receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue  bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been  released.  	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term  supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the  commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with  generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced.  	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly  forcing the utilities into bankruptcy.

3714,"Utilities' Demand Blocks Bailout  NEGOTIATIONS HIT SNAG: PG&E, Edison want end to price freeze if they sell  transmission lines to state David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Wednesday, March 21, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N114450.DTL  California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates  be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has  learned.  A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier  industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from  consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges  that rates would remain unchanged.  Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and  Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher  rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell  the state their transmission systems and some land.  The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials  realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public  Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers.  The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from  runaway wholesale electricity prices.  The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing  complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances  of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped  utilities.  The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of  the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land,  including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear  power plant.  Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's  dysfunctional electricity market.  ""Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment,""  said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that  is advising Davis in the talks.  ""The past situation has not worked well,"" he added. ""The utilities want some  certainty about their future.""  TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the  state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions  with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks.  An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday  that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale.  ""Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall,"" the official  said. ""One of the dominoes is the rate freeze.""  A PG&E spokesman declined to comment.  In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the  rate freeze for months.  The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the  PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion  in debt accrued as a result of the freeze.  ""They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in  various forms,"" said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. ""Adding it to the  present talks is consistent with past behavior.""  Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be  making progress.  Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,  told clients on Monday that the discussions ""may have lost some momentum in  recent days."" He did not give a reason.  For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the  talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent.  SECRET STICKING POINTS ""We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded,  and we will work out an agreement,"" Davis said at an appearance in San Jose.  ""But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm  not going to reveal.""  One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of  utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze.  Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms  into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the  additions was not realized by state officials until this week.  One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the  radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been  parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates.  CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking  the PUC ""to support the creditworthiness"" of the utility.  ""This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and  utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital,  consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions,""  it says.  Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state  that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from  ratepayers.  ""There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends  if it is adopted,"" the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to  disagree with such assumptions.  But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in  stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch.  ""This is a very complex transaction,"" he said. ""God and the devil are in the  details.""  E-mail David Lazarus at  ",dasovich-j

3716,"PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts  Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Wednesday, March 21, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/21/M N33580.DTL  Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other  alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a  proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening.  A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward  energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates.  Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which  would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who  requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities  that buy their power return to solvency.  Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for  not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or  ""QFs"" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates.  ""It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the  money designed to compensate the QFs,"" Davis said. ""It's immoral and has to  stop.""  Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil  refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's  supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not  paid them since November.  The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers  contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday,  according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power  grid.  The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday  meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract  at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said.  The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more  than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor  one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings  from other creditors.  The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work.  ""It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,"" said Sen. Debra  Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash  on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. ""The utilities owe it to the people of the  state to pay them.""  Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative  producers ahead of their other creditors.  But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes  alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the  governor's office about possible payment structures.  Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural  gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash  they must close their plants.  ""We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten  the health of everyone else,"" said V. John White, legislative director of the  Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers.  CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the  Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility  asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with  Edison which has paid them nothing since November.  CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes  the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day.  ""We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in  a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest  employer in the county,"" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager.  Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar.  ""We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet  delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs  to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen  rates,"" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.  The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators  comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for  legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations  eventually failed to move forward.  E-mail Greg Lucas at  ",dasovich-j
3717,"California governor blames utilities for blackouts   By JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press  SACRAMENTO, Calif. (March 21, 2001 8:10 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) -  Gov. Gray Davis said the state's two largest utilities are partly to blame  for this week's widespread blackouts because they failed to pay millions of  dollars owed to environmentally friendly power generators.  Davis said the utilities took money from customers while failing to pay the  alternative plants, which use renewable forms of energy like steam and  natural gas to generate electricity.  The state has been spending about $45 million a day since January to buy  power for customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and  Electric Co., which are so credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them.  ""It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not  pay the generators,"" the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday.  ""They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop.""  The state lost about 3,100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 3.1  million homes, on Tuesday from alternative energy plants that say they can't  afford to keep operating because the utilities haven't paid their bills in  weeks.  Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the  utilities to pre-pay future bills to the alternative plants.  PG&E called Gray's statements ""inappropriate and unjustified,"" adding that it  was negotiating a payment plan with the suppliers. Edison said it is intent  on paying creditors and working with the Public Utilities Commission to pay  the plants for future power sales.  Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to  climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation  law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.  Keepers of the state's power grid were cautiously optimistic that California  might get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts after  two idle plants were returned to service.  ""Never say never - but it appears we are going to be in better shape tomorrow  (Wednesday) and for the rest of the week,"" said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman  for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the  state's power grid.  About a half-million customers were hit by Tuesday's blackouts, which snarled  traffic and plunged schools and businesses into darkness from San Diego to  the Oregon border.  On Tuesday, Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell called on PUC President  Loretty Lunch to resign. Lynch was appointed by Davis.  Lynch couldn't be reached for comment, but a spokesman for the governor  dismissed Campbell's complaints.  Meanwhile, a leading lawmaker on energy issues said the PUC may soon have to  raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities'  bills.  ""My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able  to plan for it,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley. ""They don't have to like it,  but I think they'll appreciate it.""  Davis has said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their  bills without further rate increases.  In the meantime, the ISO is counting on conservation to avoid more rolling  blackouts. Dorinson estimated that conservation accounted for about 900  megawatts in savings during Tuesday's peak usage.  ""That probably was the difference today in helping us avoid any rolling  blackouts late into the evening,"" Dorinson said.  Tuesday's outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until  about 2 p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at  least one serious traffic accident.  The blackouts were caused by a combination of problems, including  unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the Pacific  Northwest, numerous power plants being shut down for repairs and the loss of  power from alternative generators.

3718,"Mike:  Here are my comments.  Apologies for the fact that they are quick and  dirty.  All Enron's public statements that I have read, including, I think,  statements made to financial analysts, state that our exposure in California  is not ""material.""  Dennis' declaration says that the situation in California  has been a ""financial disaster,"" that ""Enron has lost over $300 million,"" and  that ""Enron stands to lose millions more.""  The losses are described as  ""huge.""  Perhaps this is information that has since been communicated to the  market, but I'm not aware of it.  And if it hasn't, it could represent a  significant conflict with previous statements.  Seems prudent to run this by  IR and perhaps others before releasing. Regarding the statements about our hedging strategy.  It would seem prudent  to run this through the organization for comment and discussion prior to  making public. Very minor technical point--I don't think that AB 1890 was passed  ""unanimously.""  I think that there was 1 nay vote. The statement is made that ""the utilities were required to sell off most of  their generating capacity.""  The utilities were only required to sell off 1/2  of their fossil-fired plants (which I think at the time may have amounted to  about .2-.25 of their total gen assets).  They chose voluntarily to sell of  the remainder of their fossil-fired plants. It is stated that stranded costs are ""investments in imprudent power  generation facilities.""  These investments were in fact found in the past to  be prudent by the PUC.  Would therefore not seem accurate to call them  imprudent now. Is it now ""virtually impossible to manage commodity risk"" in California?   Just wondering if judge might view the statement as overstating the situation  somewhat. From a PR perspective, I'm wondering if we want to characterize re-sourcing  UC/CSU in the following manner, ""It was actually a relatively easy decision  to make.""

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Assembly Republicans have called for the  resignation of Loretta Lynch, president of the state's Public Utilities  Commission, saying they have no confidence that the state's top regulator  will ""play a constructive role in solving the state's energy crisis.""  	Assembly Republican Minority Leader Bill Campbell, R-Villa Park, sent a  letter Tuesday to Gov. Gray Davis on behalf of the Assembly's Republican  Caucus asking Davis to call for Lynch's resignation.  	 	 	? 	""With efforts to solve California's energy crisis floundering in the midst of  unpaid bills, stalled negotiations and rolling blackouts, it has come time to  ask for the resignation of your appointed president of the California Public  Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch,"" the letter said.  	Both Lynch and a spokesman for Davis were unavailable for comment.  	Lynch, a former attorney, was appointed president of the PUC by Davis in  March 2000. She is the state's top regulator, in charge of regulating  utilities, telecommunications, commercial transportation and water companies.  Before her appointment to the PUC, Lynch was head of Davis's office of  Planning and Research.  	The letter says the PUC had a number of opportunities last summer to keep the  electricity crisis from spiraling out of control by allowing Edison  International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp.  (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Sempra Energy (SRE, news,  msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric to sign long-term power supply contracts  for about $50 a megawatt-hour, nearly $30 lower than the new long-term  contracts Davis said the state entered into recently with generators.  	Lynch's failure to ""ensure that the commission's Aug. 3, 2000, emergency  order on long-term contracts was quickly implemented has placed the state  budget at risk for costs now at least 40% higher,"" the letter said. ""This  hesitancy in a crisis will cost California's economy tens of billions of  dollars during the next 20 years.""  	The state has spent more than $3 billion since January buying power in the  spot market. Davis has asked lawmakers for another $500 million from the  general fund to continue buying power. If the $500 million is granted, the  state's commitment to power purchases will surpass $4 billion.  	State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, however, said last week that the Senate  Budget Committee will deny further requests for funding unless the PUC carves  out a revenue stream for the state's Department of Water Resources, the  agency that is now buying the bulk of the state's power on behalf of the  cash-strapped utilities.  	The PUC was expected to release guidelines last week on rates the DWR can  receive from utilities to pay back the general fund and to issue revenue  bonds to pay for long-term contracts. But the guidelines haven't yet been  released.  	Last year, the PUC said the utilities could enter into limited long-term  supply contracts to hedge their positions against price spikes. But the  commission also said it feared if the utilities signed long-term deals with  generators, liquidity in the wholesale market would be reduced.  	The Republican lawmakers said the commission is responsible for nearly  forcing the utilities into bankruptcy.

3754,"Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell  Electricity Elsewhere  Business Wire 03/22/01, 4:43p (Copyright , 2001, Business Wire)  EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled  today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can  temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term  contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the  contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.  Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the  Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court  seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts  with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is  unable to pay for power demand.  David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, ""We applaud this short-term  solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean,  renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court  action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation.""  Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect  approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced  since Nov 1. The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and  legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said. ""That debt will  continue to place a great strain on our operation.""  He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from  ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.  On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot  market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in  negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E. That lower price had been  incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after  Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the  California Public Utility Commission's proposed order. California taxpayers  will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open  market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.  ""It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our  electricity,"" Sokol said. ""That is the result of inaction by the state and  bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of  the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would  assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our  clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state  fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what  we are allowed under federal law.""  Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement  proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission  that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for  electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.  But, Sokol cautioned, ""While we are hopeful that this legislative and  regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be  worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a  serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills  from qualifying facilities.""  He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no  plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million  Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.  CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total  of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.  Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about  12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes.  Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells  that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in  fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit.  The generating plants convert the water to ""live"" steam, the pressure of  which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the  slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a  renewable resource.  CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a  group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore  options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed  more than $300 million by Edison.  Note to Editors: David Sokol will discuss today's ruling in a media  teleconference at 2:30 p.m. PST today, March 22.

3755,"Yes, it's technically true, but it doesn't seem relevant.  It's a  technicality.  That is, if at the end of the contract, UC/CSU goes to another  provider, the rules would require Enron to ""de-DASR,"" after which the new  provider would submit the new DASR to switch the customer over.  The utility  stands in the middle of all this.  I don't think this equates to what UC/CSU  is claiming the problem is.  Might be viewed as a bit ""cute"" by the judge.

3789,"Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly  slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of  the following events.  In sum:  Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met  with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.   DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by  100%.  (See attached story.) Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because  Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, ""don't move 8X (a bill that  Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work;  they need much more.""  It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis  likes it or not. The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had  been informed of the ""bombshell.""  Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the  situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.) Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they  won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to  implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.) Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in  which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market  proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.  ****************************************************************************** *********************************************************************** Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness  Michael Kahn Friday, March 23, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/23/E D103778.DTL  COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov.  Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to  light a candle than curse the darkness.  Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme.  The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed.  -- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission?  -- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could  charge customers?  -- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to  sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory  pricing by out-of-state merchant generators?  -- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to  ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity?  -- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough  available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and  demand?  These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents  of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to  bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions.  The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid,  though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning  electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of  power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason  Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern  California had plenty of power.  The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities,  pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a  tangible and valuable asset in exchange.  And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing  bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long  failed at doing.  The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and  Davis' actions to enhance these efforts.  California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The  governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an  executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their  consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial  lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and  commercial buildings more energy efficient.  The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend  that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance  in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has  licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is  part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an  additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50  percent increase in generation.  And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right  sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a  strong bent toward renewable power sources.  In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the  bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the  effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable  power sources.  Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by  former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta  Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to  deal effectively with the energy emergency.  Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC  commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their  appointments.  Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was  Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise  in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president.  Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to  buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange.  This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy  price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling  additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make  California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power  grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it.  Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill  for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear  plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty  Texas- style power plants in California.  Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California.  Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new  nuclear plants.  And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a  Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants.  Most disingenuously, the apologists would ""let the market work,"" claiming  that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But  the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has  repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators  overcharged the state in January.  Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp  down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's  deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market  forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest  prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported  that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since  1999.  Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well  that if the market ""works"" to produce New York-style rate increases in  California, the consequences to the public would be dire.  Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy  conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his  expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly.  Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics'  perspective.  Michael Kahn is a member of the state Independent System Operator's board of  governors.  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 25   Bombshell Warning on Power Cost  Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature  Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, March 24, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/24/M N176940.DTL  Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state  may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the  next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent.  The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated  promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without  a rate increase.  California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity  buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to  keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back  on their feet.  Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would  have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion.  But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm.  ""There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the  negotiations, this can be added up any way you want,"" said Steve Maviglio,  press secretary to Davis.  ""Those numbers are not based on any reality right now,"" he said. ""There are  too many things up in the air.""  Assembly Democrats told a different story.  They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet  Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with  Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell.  And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow  lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration.  They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the  day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the  figures.  PURCHASES IN BILLIONS The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the  state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An  additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year,  they said.  The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17  because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases.  From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power  purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the  amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills.  Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10  billion without raising rates.  But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty  rate increase would be necessary.  INCREASE UPON INCREASE The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a  temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled  for no later than March 2002.  But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent  increase would be required to cover the debt service.  ""For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is  admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been  shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the  reality as soon as possible,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek  (Santa Cruz County).  One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to  bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them  out.  And it could mean political trouble for Davis.  ""Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's  bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002,""  said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer  Rights.  PG&E THREATENS SUIT The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to  court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors.  Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power  generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot  afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as  rolling blackouts spread across the state.  The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers  will resume debate Monday.  Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the  Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment  to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has  spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first.  Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing  plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern  California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators  provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes.  PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the  state for the billions it has spent purchasing power.  ""These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion  and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further  exacerbating an already precarious financial situation,"" Gordon Smith, PG&E's  president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.  DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in  rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds  $1. 4 billion a month.  But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their  own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible.  ""It's just absurd,"" said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. ""They  have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way.""  The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to  pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to  provide energy.  The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract  at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The  going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as  Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid  pennies on the dollar.  Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the  PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so  that it no longer considered the price of natural gas.  Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries  -- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost  them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

3794,"Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook  Davis favors tiered rate increases  David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, March 25, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/25/M N30195.DTL  Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers'  electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more  power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned.  Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff  members to accept a so-called structured rate system.  Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the  state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously  estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt  utilities.  If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double.  In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers'  average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120.  Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on  the way.  ""We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,"" said Larry  Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. ""We might as well admit  that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use  it,  let's pay for it.""  Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday  from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he  said, ""were wildly high.""  ""The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure,  "" Maviglio said. ""Until we know the results of the negotiations with the  utilities, you can't conclude anything.""  The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and  Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion  in debt.  PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California  can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the  Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two  companies.  ""The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,""  said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. ""Either wholesale prices need to come  down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large.""  Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's  energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in  disguise for the governor.  COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many  consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills.  ""I don't like either choice,"" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a  gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco  candy store.   she said.  But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate  increases and rolling blackouts.  She's moving to Texas.

3809,"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger  BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein  BODY:  ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis  fails to clean up the power mess.  ??""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. ""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic.""  ??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters  understand Davis didn't create the problem.  ??""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said. ""This is an immediate  problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year  process to get this situation back under control.""  ??As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce  their own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read  about in the newspapers have no plan.""  ??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage.  ??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the  state's congressional delegation.  ??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised  to make the hallmark of his first term.  ??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.  ??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We  don't need to go to Disneyland for that.""  ??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled  the events of the past week. ""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically  tone deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. ""His instincts are not serving him well.""  ??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them  that a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign.  ??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for  months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature.  ??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. ""I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. ""There's a high level of frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.""  ??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control. ""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do.""  ??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and  Democrats remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices.  ??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis. ""People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives,"" he said.  ??""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis).""  ??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.  ??""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said. ""That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this summer."" ",dasovich-j

Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen  Connell.  Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a  constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's  energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate  greedy energy firms selling power at ""out of control prices.""  He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to  say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities  Commission last week.

3870,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms    (Published April 4, 2001)  There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that  envelops California's energy crisis.  Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control  and the die is more or less cast. Whatever fate decrees - massive summer  blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's  utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov. Gray Davis downward are  scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals  for blame.  No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very  apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with  energy and moved to other matters. Legislative committees are working on the  hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special  committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis  have gone into semihibernation.  Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears  that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will  backfire. ""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell  warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for  perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly. ""We will be  accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said.  Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a  second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined  sharply in recent weeks. He devoted much of the weekend to defending his  actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this  problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans.  Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape  from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses  in the last three elections. The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder,  Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of  mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill  Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis  Davis.  The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every  sign of worsening. Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled  ""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's  apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit.  The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power  purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into  a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves. The  long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases  have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for  them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float.  Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase  market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a  deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit.  Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the  state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall  Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power  generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission  grid have stalled, perhaps permanently.  The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the  specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air  conditioners or medical equipment shut down. And the utilities are closer to  bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis.  Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy. With  Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to  protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

The ISO would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised RFB.  As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB. Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load portion.  Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized.  Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB.  This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the next 24 hours.  <<DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc>>   - DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc",dasovich-j

3879,"Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry   Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being  misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also  predicting bigger profits for investors.   By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers   In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's  power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of  speeding up deregulation. Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc.  executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power.""  That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall  Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost  revenue and stock value. ""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes  across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson  declared in a publication targeting large investors. ""The energy  marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile.""  Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and  public records shows. In the years since California's pioneering deregulation  plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending  similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers. Now, those divergent messages--electricity prices will fall but corporate  revenue and profits will climb--will be a key focus of a special state Senate  committee charged with investigating the alleged manipulation in the power  market. ""How you can tell your investors you're about to make a whole ton of money in  the very short term, and tell the consumers of California you're about to get  lower rates?"" said Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), a former consumer attorney  who is heading the legislative probe.  Investigations by the state attorney general and federal regulators are  continuing, but remain largely secret. The Senate panel could offer the most open and wide-ranging examination yet  of alleged misconduct among power sellers. The bipartisan panel expects to  begin requesting documents from power producers as early as today and begin  hearings in a few weeks. Committee members stress that they are hoping the  power companies will cooperate but are ready to issue subpoenas if necessary.  Suppliers Deny Misleading Public The legislative probe comes as many state officials are moving aggressively  to expose alleged market manipulation and overcharges totaling billions of  dollars by the power suppliers. ""Somewhere along the line, there may be a skunk in the woodpile. And if there  is, we need to find out about it,"" said K. Maurice Johannessen (R-Redding),  the committee's ranking Republican. Another panel member, Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), noted that all  companies try to maximize profits. ""But [we want] to understand how the  market was manipulated and how sellers took advantage of the market."" The power traders strongly deny acting improperly or sending misleading  signals to the public. ""Hogwash,"" said Tom Williams, spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy.  Spokesmen for Dynegy said there was nothing inconsistent in the statements of  their executives. The companies maintain that California's problems stem from soaring  electricity demand, lagging power plant construction and a faulty  deregulation plan adopted by the Legislature in 1996. ""You have a flawed  structure there,"" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa. Sousa and executives of other power suppliers say their comments to the  general public and to Wall Street are not contradictory because unfettered  competition--not the California model--would have created opportunities to  both make money and cut rates. Still, regulators, lawmakers and ratepayer groups note that only half the  promises made by the power dealers have been realized so far--their earnings  and stock prices have risen at record rates as electricity prices have soared. ""The big lie was, while they were telling ratepayers to 'Trust us, we're  going to lower your rates,' they were planning the entire time to raise the  rates,"" said San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre, a former federal prosecutor  who specialized in fraud cases. Aguirre is representing state ratepayers in a  class-action lawsuit against the power companies. Just last month, California's independent grid operator reported that many  power sellers ""used well-planned strategies to ensure maximum possible  prices."" Potential overcharges could total nearly $6.3 billion.  The Senate panel wants to track information that Dynegy and other generators  were providing to the investment community in the 1990s as a possible way of  determining whether they entered the California market with plans to run up  electricity costs. Among many other things, the committee plans to seek  internal projections of how the firms expected wholesale prices and profits  to rise under deregulation.  Members also want to know how the suppliers expected to recoup billions in  outlays for California power plants being unloaded by regulated utilities.  Some of the purchases were far above book value, stunning analysts. ""What did they know that the rest of us didn't at the time they were  purchasing those generations facilities?"" asked Dunn. ""They knew something."" One thing the power wholesalers say they did know was that tight power  supplies in California would probably boost prices, at least for a time. ""They were going anywhere where they thought energy [use] would spike  upward,"" recalled market analyst Joan Goodman, who was familiar with company  pitches. ""California was one of those places because it didn't have  sufficient [power] plants."" Duke Energy projected that prices would rise after 2000, although the company  says it did not foresee the huge increases that occurred, according to  spokesman Williams. However, when the company sealed one of the first packages of power plant  purchases in the state in 1997, Chief Executive Officer Richard Priory said  in a press release it would ""deliver greater value"" to California customers. The publicity spin was similar when Edison's sprawling beachfront power plant  in El Segundo changed hands the following year. ""Consumers in California will  begin to benefit from more competitively priced electricity and more vibrant  economy,"" announced Craig Mataczynski, vice president of Minneapolis-based  NRG Corp., a partner in the purchase with Dynegy.  Big Growth Was Predicted Utilities reaping profits from plant sales also trumpeted the consumer  windfall theme. Electricity rates would drop 20% by 2001, Pacific Gas &  Electric's top executive, Robert Glynn, said in early 1998. ""There is no  product bought on a daily basis that has such a predictable downward price  trajectory into the future."" But to its Wall Street audience, the power suppliers emphasized climbing  revenues. Atlanta-based Southern Co., now Mirant, told investors in 1999 that its plan  to buy plants and market power had brought the company to the ""doorstep of  significant growth opportunities."" ""We believe our strategies will result in the best shareholder return  available,"" Bill Dahlberg, then-chief executive officer, said shortly after  buying three California plants. Mirant spokeswoman Jamie Stephenson said assurances given the public and  assumptions directed to Wall Street were ""just a different way of delivering  the same message."" The firm was saying it would be ""reliable to shareholders  and reliable to consumers."" Now, with rolling blackouts and record electricity bill increases, federal  and state authorities are alleging that large energy suppliers played the  power market too hard. Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it found evidence  of $124 million in ""unjust and unreasonable"" charges during the severest  periods of electricity shortage. The commission, often criticized for being  too lenient on private power companies, ordered the firms to refund the money  or further justify the charges. Some firms are contesting the findings, saying the prices they charged were  justified.  Investigators and regulators have faced a vexing challenge trying to unravel  the complex financial workings of the large power traders. The companies  closely guard information, and some recently refused to comply with subpoenas  from the state Public Utilities Commission, which is also probing the power  market. Whether the Senate investigating committee will have the resources and  tenacity to get much further remains to be seen. But Democrats and  Republicans alike insist they are serious about untangling how the power  market went haywire. ""I haven't seen that much smoke where there hasn't been a fire,"" Dunn said.

3903,"HEADLINE: ?Calif. Governor To Address State  BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.  BODY:  ???While Gov. Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.  ??Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.''  ??Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  and Southern California Edison Co. He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live.  ??California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.  ??On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter  state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency  power. The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also  threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.  ??Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to  California this year.  ??A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly. It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold  it at much higher rates.  ??''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state. This  profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.  ??Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal. He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California.  ??''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can  to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price. Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.  ??Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that  manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense. The only things companies understand is leverage.''  ??For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.  ??The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea. They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities.   HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning  BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens  BODY:  ??LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California  gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's  energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch  spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.  ??""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages.  ??""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.  ??No one in the audience doubted that. After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups.  ??But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights. She promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out  of the California economy and not adding a whit of value.""  ??Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.  ??Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate  hike.  ??Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.  ??Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment"" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that ""true deregulation is our goal."" The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" from management of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.  ??A panel of experts offered some grim predictions. ""We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager.  ??Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading. ""This may go on for a while and it's not just California,"" he said. ""In the near term we've got chaos,"" he added.  ??But he offered one macabre ray of hope. He said that federal policymakers  may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling  blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President  Bush's brother is governor.  ??Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.

3919,"Energy supply setback: Big generator can't be forced to sell emergency power  to the state, a U.S. court rules. By Denny Walsh and Carrie Peyton BEE STAFF WRITERS (Published April 6, 2001)  In a development that does not bode well for California's energy supply, a  federal appellate court Thursday halted enforcement of a lower court order  that a big electricity generator must sell emergency power to the state  without guarantee of payment.  State energy officials said the ruling wouldn't have any immediate effect but  could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant  off-line for maintenance.  On March 21, citing ""rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California  landscape,"" U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction  against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation's major generators.  Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20  percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found  that loss of that production ""poses an imminent threat.""  But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown ""a high  likelihood of success on the merits"" of its appeal.  While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the  question of the courts' jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel  directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in  July.  The decision leaves California's electric grid more fragile, at least  temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which  maintains and controls power transmissions.  It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any  of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers.  ""It's not going to change anything overnight, and it's not going to change  anything over the weekend,"" said Detmers. ""But if Reliant decided on a  unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely  could have a system emergency.""  Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but  declined to specify their next move.  ""Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California,"" said company  lobbyist Marty Wilson, and ""is still of a mind to want to cooperate.""  Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District  Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co.,  alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and  production of electricity.  The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of  interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales  into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order,  and that goes directly to an appellate court.  The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two  other generators to respond to ISO's emergency orders for power, even though  the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly  in debt.  Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can't pay  their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to  the utilities.  The other three defendants in the ISO's suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston  and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing &  Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue  supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to  sell to companies that are not creditworthy.  But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can  rescind those agreements with 48 hours' notice.  ""My hope is this is a temporary setback,"" said Robinson. He added, however,  that the practical effect is ""at least for now, we don't have a tool to  compel them to do what we believe they're obligated to do"" -- respond to  emergency demands for power.  Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no  jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators  and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must  settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs.  In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special  expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO.  ""Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court  agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper,"" he  said. ""But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short  supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at  risk.""  Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit's order Thursday, attorneys for  the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend  the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its  view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has  jurisdiction.  Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday.  In a further development that could complicate the state's dire need for  energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big  utilities and sell its power on the open market.  Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants  that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in  Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell  its power to PG&E.  The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative  energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell  their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state.

3946,"NEWSMAKER PROFILE  Dennis Montali  Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career  Well-known expert in complex cases  Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Legal Affairs Writer Saturday, April 7, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/07/M N180032.DTL  A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots  in California's long, drawn-out power crisis.  Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot-  coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is  about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is  relishing the challenge.  ""He's one of the best judges in the country,"" said Lawrence Goldberg, a San  Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. ""He  loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court.""  Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who  often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of  bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more  complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes.  On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of  the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a  mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say.  ""He's an excellent draw for the case,"" said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn  Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali  has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him  understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis.  Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay  Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and  later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The  young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and  then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps  commitment.  After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt  School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968.  He joined the law firm of  Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in  bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison &  Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert.  While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's  attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his  knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community.  In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening  on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California.  One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in  doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with  crises quickly and with few complications.  He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of  Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was  rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel.  When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian  food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk  his dog and spend time with his granddaughter.  ""He's going to put his heart into this one,"" said Larry Engel, a veteran  bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. ""He's got  the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence.""  ""California,"" he added, ""is in really good hands in having the case with  him.""

3947,"Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action  FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River  Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the  natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were  happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved.  ""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is  something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the  ""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned  Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although  she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC  ""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.""  Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action  expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the  ""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it. Critics  claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler  Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she  noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.  ""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in  the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how  our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing  electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said. If anything,  she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even  worse than it is.  There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the  project was certificated, she noted. ""It would be counterproductive for this  Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without  ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more  importantly, that they will cause no further harm.""  The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas  and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers,  that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing  customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over  expansion shippers.  ""We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative  impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,"" the order said  [CP01-106. For starters, ""the record does not show that pro-rata allocations  of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge."" Kern River  reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at  Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result  of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the  Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598  MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave  Pipeline shippers, it noted.  ""Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be  greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes.  The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes  attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to  Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide  sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,"" the order said.  ""The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at  Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing  the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation  path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction.""  The project would increase the ""limited-term, incremental transportation  capacity"" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help  address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900  horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor  stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and  an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has  a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year.  Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the  project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced  by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending  at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of  the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project  recently went through an open season  ",dasovich-j

3967,"  (April 2001)  PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory  more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000.  Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate  freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels  in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by  roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was  reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the  uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase,  these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that  could be achieved through pricing incentives.

3978,"Here's how I think this thing has played (is playing) out:  PG&E was very tactical. They knew that the Edison deal was imminent. They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests. They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous  once the Governor announced the Edison deal. Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that  they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy.   (Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.) So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the  Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch. 11,  not the way of J. Bryson and Edison.

Assume C&I takes its proportionate share of the DWR's net short (i.e., if C&I  is 2/3 of load, then 2/3 of CDW purchases should go to C&I) You can use the average price used in the DWR presentation to Legislators to  the $ amount.  The copy I've got sez that the average price for the first 5  years is $79/MWH.  That seems like the # we ought to use. Now the hard part.  The state reportedly sez that they aren't buying the  entire net short---only that part that they feel like covering.  So how do we  factor that in?  Not sure that we can get detailed data (but check with Alan  Comnes, who might be able to provide ISO real time prices (which is where the  net short (of the net short) is being filled ISO---the ISO then sends that  bill to PG&E. An easier way might be to use PG&E's numbers.  In their bankruptcy  announcement, PG&E sez that it's been costing them $300MM per month ($300MM *  0.67 * 0.10 =~$20MM).  We could scale this number up to account for summer  purchases. Alternatively, we could use ENA's forward curve.

Best, Jeff    Power deregulation backfires in infancy (9.27.2000) MANY OFFICIALS SAY IT WILL WORK EVENTUALLY  BY STEVE JOHNSON Mercury News  With its residents reeling from surging summertime electricity bills, this  coastal state's deregulated energy market has triggered bitter accusations,  legislative hearings and a push to re-regulate the whole system.  Sound familiar? Except this isn't California. It's New York, one of 23 other  states that are ending what has been for decades one of government's key  functions -- keeping tight control on the price of power.  The great national experiment to open the sale of electricity to competition,  which California has been largely credited with pioneering, was supposed to  lower prices by freeing consumers from the monopolistic grip of government  regulated utilities. Indeed, energy officials in many states retain hope that  it eventually will do that.  But throughout the country, a sense of foreboding has overtaken people like  Susan Peckman, who manages Peckman's Liquor Store in Pearl River, N.Y. Hers  is the only state outside California so far where consumers have been exposed  to the discomfitting impact of fully deregulated prices. And she doesn't feel  liberated.  ``There's nothing we can do about it,'' said Peckman, who estimated that her  store's electricity bill has jumped about 20 percent this summer over last  year's. Faced with the option of paying it or closing down, she added,  ``you're between a rock and a hard place.''  It has been four years since California became one of the first states to  pass an energy deregulation law. Yet the movement to revamp the way power is  sold in this country remains mired in a ``prolonged and muddled transition,''  according to a study published this month by Cambridge Energy Research  Associates and the Arthur Andersen consulting firm.  It's unclear when or even if that transition will ever be completed. In many  parts of the country, public officials are terrified of plunging ahead with  deregulation, given the high prices and other problems in California and New  York. Some even harbor suspicions that California has led the nation astray  by promoting an idea that is inherently flawed.  California Public Utilities Commissioner Henry Duque said he encountered that  attitude during a summer meeting of the National Association of Regulatory  Utility Commissioners in Los Angeles.  ``I had other commissioners coming up to me saying, `What the hell is going  on here,' '' Duque said. ``They were concerned. I think their thought was,  did we in California see something that was wrong with deregulation but  weren't going to level with them now that they had started down the path?''  Actually, the federal government bears much of the responsibility for  initiating the drive to ease public control of electricity markets.  Hoping to encourage new sources of electricity, Congress passed laws in 1978  and 1992 that forced utility companies to buy increasing amounts of the power  they use from other, unregulated energy suppliers. In 1996, the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission also made it possible for other firms to ship  their power over the high-voltage lines the utilities owned.  Consumers were looking for a change, too. By the mid-1990s, the service  provided by utility firms had become a sore subject. California had some of  the highest utility rates in the country, and the electrical system's  reliability was under fire.  If only other companies could be lured into the market to compete, it was  widely assumed, prices would plummet and overall customer satisfaction would  improve.  New York, New Hampshire and Rhode Island passed laws or made administrative  rulings to deregulate slightly before California, where deregulation was  approved in September 1996.  Rhode Island and Massachusetts were first to give residents the ability to  choose which company sold them their electricity. But because of its size and  much publicized deliberations about its plan to deregulate during the 1990s,  California was labeled the national leader on the issue.  In many ways, however, deregulation in the state has been a flop -- at least,  so far.  Californians have had the right to pick their energy supplier since March 31,  1998, when the electricity market was officially unfettered. That ability to  choose was seen as an essential way to spur competition and, ultimately,  lower energy prices.  But as of Aug. 15, less than 2 percent of California's homeowners, businesses  and others had seen fit to drop their local utility for some other supplier.  By contrast, in Pennsylvania -- one of 13 other states that now let people  choose -- 10 percent of customers have switched.  Critics say that's a misleading comparison since Pennsylvania, unlike  California, gives an energy price discount to consumers who make the switch.  Nonetheless, Pennsylvania officials are clearly happy about how deregulation  is working.  A study in August by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge concluded that electricity  competition will result in 36,400 new jobs and a $1.4 billion boost in  personal income across the state by 2004.  ``We do not anticipate the problems in Pennsylvania that you have out there  in California,'' said Kevin Cadden, a spokesman with that state's Public  Utility Commission. ``I am not nervous at all.''  A study this summer by the non-profit Center for the Advancement of Energy  Markets, which promotes deregulation, found that Pennsylvania has pushed  electricity competition more effectively and quickly than any other state.  Others listed in order in the top 10 were New York, Maine, Massachusetts,  Texas, Nevada, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecticut. California  was 16th.  But consumers may have a different measure of success: whether their lights  will stay on and how much electricity will cost them once government controls  are removed. Unfortunately, in the two states where prices have been fully  deregulated, the evidence is not encouraging.  In San Diego, the first place in California to have its state-mandated cap on  utility rates lifted under deregulation, electricity bills for many consumers  this summer doubled, while power blackouts also rolled through Northern  California. New York's experience wasn't quite as bad. But in the few  counties there that were exposed to fully deregulated electricity rates this  summer, the average residential bill rose 22 percent.  Investigations are under way in California and New York to determine what  happened. Nonetheless, the problems in both states have been largely blamed  on an insufficient supply of power plants to meet their demand for  electricity, which has forced consumers to pay just about whatever  power-producing firms want to charge.  ``It's the piece that the economists missed'' when deregulation was touted  several years ago, said Mike Donovan, a spokesman for Orange and Rockland  Utilities, Inc., which supplies power to Susan Peckman's Pearl River liquor  store, among other parts of New York. ``There isn't sufficient generation to  really administer a full-scale competitive market.''  Ralph Cavanagh of the National Resources Defense Council in San Francisco  maintains that deregulation has been unfairly maligned because the dearth of  power plants has made it impossible for consumers to benefit from  competition. Once that and some other problems are fixed, he said, ``I'm  confident we'll have a more orderly market in the future.''  Others are growing nervous, however. This summer's difficulties have spurred  calls to significantly stall or even reverse deregulation in North Carolina,  Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Oregon and Alabama, among other states.  A Wisconsin consumer advocate recently chuckled over the phone as she read  aloud a story about California's energy crisis, noting that such news made  her opposition to deregulation much easier.  ``I am absolutely convinced that we are on an inexorable march toward the  choice model,'' said Ken Malloy, president of the Center for the Advancement  of Energy Markets. But he acknowledged that the experience in San Diego and  New York ``is undeniably a bad thing that has happened to this movement, and  it will set us back.''   Contact Steve Johnson at  ",dasovich-j

4014,"In Idaho, Western states press feds to act on power prices  H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer Tuesday, April 10, 2001  ,2001 Associated Press  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/04/10/nation al1812EDT0713.DTL  (04-10) 18:04 PDT BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- High electricity prices pose a  ``looming disaster'' for many states in the West, a federal regulator warned  Tuesday, as pressure grew on the government to consider temporary price  controls on wholesale power.  Officials from 11 Western states, including energy-ravaged California,  engaged in sometimes passionate exchanges with three members of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission over how to contain soaring power prices that  are expected to go only higher this summer.  ``Something has to be done to tame this market,'' Geoffrey Brown, a member of  the California Public Utilities Commission, told the three FERC  commissioners. California anticipates paying $65 billion for electricity this  year, almost 10 times its power bill in 1999.  But after the daylong session, the FERC seemed to be not much closer to  imposing price caps than before, although one commissioner, Linda Breathitt,  said she now wants to look the issue more carefully and might be swayed.  FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, reiterated his  fear that price regulation would drive off investors for new power  generation. Under FERC rules, it would be Hebert's discretion when or if to  propose a price cap for deliberation.  Commissioner William Massey, who has been in the minority on the commission  in recommending price controls, said the ``passion for markets must be  tempered with common sense.''  ``We face a looming disaster,'' he declared, if wholesale electricity markets  are allowed to continue on a path that has wholesale power in many parts of  the West selling for 10 times what it cost just a year ago.  Hebert insisted that the FERC ``is doing everything it can'' to ensure just  and reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million  in refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon  to approve a new system of tracking market abuses.  The chairman noted that state officials at the meeting were sharply divided  over whether the government should regulate electricity prices. Keeping tabs  as each participant gave a presentation, he said three states were for them,  five against and three uncertain.  Hebert's anti-controls position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney  in a telephone interview with Associated Press reporter David Ammons in  Olympia, Wash.  ``The problem with price caps,'' Cheney said, ``is that they don't solve the  problem. Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail  level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has  driven PG&E into bankruptcy.''  Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had  debts of $9 billion and filed for protection from its creditors under chapter  11 of federal bankruptcy laws.  California, whose electricity problems have unleashed soaring power prices  throughout the West, urged FERC to immediately impose an 18-month cost-based  price cap in the Western markets.  ``We have done our part. We cannot do it alone,'' said Bob Hertzberg, speaker  of the California Assembly. He cited state actions to boost conservation,  increase retail rates and speed up power plant construction and said there is  ``no earthly reason'' why energy prices should be 10 times what they were a  year ago.  Still, California officials expressed little optimism after the hearing.  ``It would take a dramatic, unprecedented change of direction'' for the FERC  to adopt price controls, said Fred Keeley, speaker pro tem in the California  Assembly, who was in the audience during the six-hour meeting.  Breathitt, the FERC's third commissioner, who has not come out in favor of  price caps, nevertheless indicated she might be inching toward some controls.  She said she wants the commission to ``seriously discuss a price  implementation plan.''  The issue may end up, however, being decided by two new commissioners  recently nominated by President Bush -- Pat Wood, now head of the Texas  utility commission, and Nora Brownell, a Pennsylvania regulator.  Both are viewed as free market advocates, but pro-controls commissioner  Massey said he believes they might be swayed to accept temporary price  restraints if the electricity market reels further out of control. Neither  nominee has yet been confirmed by the Senate.  While divided on price controls, most of the state officials at the unusual  FERC meeting expressed worries that the federal agency was doing too little  to address problems in the power markets.  The chairman of Montana's utility commission, Gary Feland, who opposes price  controls, criticized FERC for lack of aggressiveness in challenging  unreasonable prices. FERC is legally mandated to ensure ``just and  reasonable'' wholesale power prices.  ``Montana is taking a hell of a hit'' from electricity prices, Feland said.  ``Politically we're getting beat up.''  Steve Ellenbecker, a utility commissioner from Wyoming, urged the federal  regulators to come up with a ``reasonable measure'' short of a price cap to  deal with the troubled electricity market.  Many of the state officials said the full impact of the high wholesale power  prices have yet to hit consumers. In many cases state officials must still  give permission for utilities to pass them on to retail customers.  On the Net: FERC Web site: www.ferc.fed.us/  ,2001 Associated Press ? ",dasovich-j

4035,"Judge orders Enron to deliver electricity to universities   Updated: April 11, 2001 - 2:06 p.m.  SAN FRANCISCO -- Saying that Enron Energy Systems Inc. may be in breach of  contract, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Houston company to abide by  its agreement to sell cheap power to the state's public universities.   Enron was attempting to get out of delivering power for the final year of a  four-year deal with the California State University and University of  California systems.   Enron, which buys power from producers and sells it on the market, said the  contract would cost the energy concern $12 million a month because of  skyrocketing wholesale power prices.   Enron said the state should free Enron from its obligation and taxpayers  should pick up the tab.   ""It's our economic interest to provide a service with the least amount of  dollars we can provide it for,"" Enron attorney A. William Urquhart said. He  later described the case as being ""all about money. It's all about money.""   Enron said it would file an emergency appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of  Appeals in San Francisco to overturn U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton's  ruling in the suit brought by the state's two university systems.   Appearing in federal court, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer argued that  Enron wants out of the contract so it can engage in a ""marketing game"" with  the universities' promised power and sell it on the open market for 10 times  more than what the electricity cost Enron.   He said lawmakers may have ""left the keys in the car"" when they approved  California's failed energy deregulation scheme that has prompted the energy  crisis, ""But it is still theft to steal the car.""   The judge issued a temporary injunction against Enron, forcing it to continue  providing service as the suit brought by the universities proceeds. When the  judge issued the order, she also said there is a likelihood Enron will lose  the suit.   ""I am persuaded, in the end, there is a very strong likelihood of success on  the breach of contract claim,"" the judge said.   UC's annual electric bill is about $87 million and its natural gas bill is  about $26 million. CSU annually pays about $40 million for electricity and  $20 million for natural gas.   The case is UC Regents vs. Enron Energy Systems Inc., 01-1006.   -- Associated Press  ",dasovich-j

CLFP proposes the Commission establish an optional summer on-peak, peak period consisting of a continuous 3-hour period during the current summer on-peak period for both utilities.  The 3-hour period would be selected by the customer.  Specifically:   Service Eligibility:  Customers served as medium or large commercial/industrial customers on time-of-use rates and metered accordingly.  Examples - PG&E's E-19, E-20, etc. and SCE's TOU-8, etc.   Customer Eligibility:  Electric customers processing, handling, distributing or processing perishable food and agriculture products.  (As noted below, since no revenue shift occurs within the class, the Commission may consider opening the option to others.)   Customer Charge Surcharge:  A surcharge of $130 per meter per month for the initial summer period (2001) to offset the utilities cost for changes to billing procedures.  In the case of optimal billing period service customers the surcharge shall correspond with such billing period.   Optional Summer On-Peak Period:  Any continuous 3-hour period during the summer-on-peak period of time.  Hours may be designated by the customer consistent with metering capabilities of the customer or changes to metering capability.   The reason for designation by the food processor or agriculture commodity processing customer is in order to take into account the many factors involved in load shedding.  Labor, harvesting schedules and coordination with growers, delivery schedules, inspection activity, etc. All bear upon such an effort.   Rate for Optional Summer-On-Peak Period Service:  Energy rates for the 3-hour period would be two times the otherwise applicable charge for summer-on-peak energy.  The other 3 hours of the 6-hour on-peak period would be billed at the non-peak rate and equalized for rate/revenue neutrality. In the event partial peak periods are retained, the rate for the non-optioned 3-hour period during the on-peak period would be adjusted to retain revenue neutrality.  These rates would apply, as now, workdays of Monday - Friday.   Notice and Service:  An eligible customer must notify the utility in writing, by fax, email, or hand delivered, to both the appropriate account representative and the customer billing department of the request for optional summer-on-peak period service.  The 3-hour period of optional service and the start date for such service shall be specified.  Start dates should coincide with billing cycles, with a minimum of seven days notice prior to such cycle.  Optional optimal billing period customers would be treated accordingly, except as currently provided, a two-day advance notice.   Implementation Issues - TOU Meters and Billing.  It appears the number of customer meters and billing changes potentially required by optional summer on-peak period service is relatively small compared to the total number of meters of the utilities.",dasovich-j

Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out,  we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the  variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial  groups for buy-in.  We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger  Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look  like by middle of next week.  How's this plan sound?  Few other points:  We assume that bullet 6's reference to ""net"" means that the deferral is  calculated by taking any ""overcollections"" and subtracting them from any  ""undercollections"" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year. What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?  We're assuming it's  commercially driven.  We correct?  If so, what's the driver?  Same goes for  the 2004 ending date. Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an ""Option 2""  for folks to consider.  (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be  run on ""Option 2"" until after having completed the analysis on option 1,  since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct).   Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking  treatment. Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers ""noncore,"" similar to the gas model in  California, and force those customers to choose an ESP. Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining ""core""  (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that  I want to throw out for folks to react to:  Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down  and simple as possible.  When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the  over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation? In option 2, by adding the ""noncore"" feature, and by implementing that  feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the  proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the  utility's position).  This is not to say that the complications can't be  worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to  highlight it for folks to consider.  Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and ""Option 2.""  Best, Jeff ",dasovich-j
4075,"OK folks.  It's about 80% of the way there.

4080,"-FYI.  This is an internal email of the SVMG.  Please keep confidential.   I'll be monitoring.  Thanks.  Best, Jeff ****************************************************************************** **************************************  As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing, specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday. A copy of his proposal is attached. As I indicated at last week's meeting, I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain conditions, for the following reasons:  - It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments (blackouts).  - It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers. This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention.  - It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods.  The following is a ""strawman"" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday. I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible, an issue of concern to some. Also, I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting.  Thanks.  Peter Evans  ____________________________  Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices). This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts. Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers. We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels) at the real-time energy price.  Our support for this concept includes the following conditions:  1. Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's historical load profile. Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume. Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build in some expectation of conservation.  2. Participation  All customer classes would participate. In the absence of real time load data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price.  3. Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use  It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to. This could include self-generation, bilateral forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR.  4. Sunset  This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring government or regulatory action to extend it.   - RTP proposal 32901.doc",dasovich-j

4100,"FYI.  The agenda for the legislative oversight committee's gas hearing  tomorrow includes two Brattle Group consultants, Paul Carpenter and Matt  O'Loughlin. They will make up the first panel, titled, ""California's High  Natural Gas Prices: Market Power and Other Factors.""  In California's gas wars, Edison hired these folks--Carpenter in particular--  to show that SoCalGas has considerable market power in California and abuses  it.  (Edison was a long-time, very unhappy gas customer of SoCalGas', until  it sold off its power plants.  The animosity remains, however.)  Should be  interesting to see where the committe goes with that panel.  CA PUC lawyer, Harvey Morris, is the sole witness on the second panel.   Harvey is zealous in his assertions regarding market power in interestate  markets serving California and is the PUC's lead attorney on such matters at  FERC.  I plan on attending the hearing.

Consequently, the net short wasn't getting picked up.  That meant that the  ISO would have to go to the real-time market to close the gap.  The ISO would  then charge the utilities for the power purchased.  Recall that Bob Glynn  referenced the $300 MM/month that continued to pile up on PG&E's balance  sheet as one of the several reasons that PG&E put itself into bankruptcy.   Now that PG&E's in bankruptcy, the state is now responsible for the full net  short, and can't continue to sluff it off onto PG&E's balance sheet.  So it's  therefore no surprise that the State's daily bill for power purchases has  increased dramatically---just not for any of the bogus reasons cited by  Governor Backbone.

4176,"No smoking gun in natural-gas cost probe By Jim Sanders Bee Capitol Bureau (Published April 23, 2001)  It strikes at the heart of an energy crisis that has caused  multibillion-dollar losses and could plunge California's economy into a  tailspin: Did private companies manipulate markets to get rich off consumers'  pain?  An Assembly oversight committee spent hours last week grilling officials of  El Paso Natural Gas Co. and an affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy, companies  that were accused by state regulators of anti-competitive practices that  helped send gas prices soaring.  Committee Chairman Darrell Steinberg, D-Sacramento, said the hearing  convinced him that El Paso exercised ""market power"" -- undue influence over  supply, demand and prices -- even though no smoking gun surfaced in the  testimony.  ""You have to look at this from a common-sense perspective -- the price spikes  were astronomical,"" Steinberg said. ""Could they have occurred in such an  extraordinary fashion absent market manipulation? The answer, to me, clearly  is no.""  No wrongdoing has yet been proved, however, and El Paso officials contend  they have acted legally and ethically.  State regulators have complained to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  that El Paso and its affiliates made it difficult for others to use pipeline  capacity into California so that El Paso could constrain natural gas supply,  increase demand and enrich itself in domino-like fashion.  Attorney Harvey Morris of the state Public Utilities Commission told  legislators that El Paso improperly sold 40 percent of its California  pipeline capacity to an affiliate, which set unrealistically high shipping  prices to discourage use by others and drive up the market.  ""To us, it was pretty obvious what was going on,"" Morris testified.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate  pipelines, has dismissed a PUC allegation that El Paso illegally gave  preference to an affiliated company. But the federal agency has scheduled its  own hearing into complaints of anti-competitive practices. FERC officials  declined to testify at the Assembly hearing.  El Paso executives say gas prices have been affected by weather, storage  levels and other factors beyond their control, primarily extraordinary demand  for natural gas needed by power plants to generate electricity.  ""We're not withholding capacity -- no one is,"" Ralph Eads, president of El  Paso Merchant Energy, told the oversight panel Thursday. ""With these prices,  you want to sell every molecule.""  The controversy is fueled by records showing that natural gas prices at the  Southern California border skyrocketed -- far exceeding national averages --  soon after El Paso Merchant assumed control of 1.2 billion cubic feet of  daily pipeline capacity from its corporate parent.  The El Paso pipeline, one of two key arteries to the state line in Southern  California, stretches from Texas through New Mexico to the border town of  Topock in Arizona.  Prices more than quadrupled at Topock during the one-year period ending in  March of this year, records show. Much of that rise stemmed from  transportation rather than production costs.  By February, prices at Topock had jumped from about $2.59 per million British  thermal units to $12.69 per million Btu. Nationally, prices had risen from  about $2.61 per million Btu to just $6 per million Btu in that same period,  records show.  But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, a member of the oversight committee,  warned against using such statistics to conclude that El Paso violated any  federal pipeline laws or regulations.  Making money off a crisis is not necessarily illegal, he said. Market  conditions can place private companies in the catbird's seat, allowing them  to reap big bucks. Are they obligated -- legally, not morally -- to restrict  their profits?  ""To make the jump from profiting from a shortage to market manipulation is  not something that should be done cavalierly,"" he said.  The El Paso case is being watched closely by legislators and consumers.  The PUC says that El Paso's market manipulation will cost California gas and  electricity customers more than $100 million annually.  The Brattle Group consulting firm has placed the figure much higher,  estimating that cost increases for electricity customers of Southern  California Edison Co. alone totaled about $750 million during the past year.  El Paso and its affiliates are involved in selling pipeline space to other  natural gas companies, selling gas themselves at the California border and  generating alternative sources of electricity whose price is tied to natural  gas costs.  Shareholders stood to gain handsomely as gas prices shot upward, according to  the PUC.  El Paso Merchant's earnings before interest and taxes rose from $3 million in  1999 to $563 million in 2000, according to documents filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  The report gave no breakdown, however, of profits tied specifically to  California.  A research firm hired by El Paso, the Lukens Consulting Group, concluded that  a complex chain reaction of factors -- not manipulation -- has rocked the  state's natural gas industry and affected market dynamics and economics.  ""Higher electricity prices have caused an increase in demand for gas, which  has led to higher prices of gas, which increased demand for pipeline  capacity, which caused an increase in the price of pipeline capacity,"" the  group said in a report distributed to legislators.  But electricity generators, themselves under investigation in the Legislature  for their pricing practices, make the reverse argument: Higher natural gas  prices contributed to a rise in their costs for producing electricity.  To support claims that El Paso acted unethically, the PUC says the company  gave its affiliate an unfair competitive advantage in bidding for pipeline  capacity to Southern California by:  Structuring the auction to favor awarding the entire bloc to a single bidder.  Twenty-four companies submitted bids for portions of the pipe. Only El Paso  Merchant sought all of the capacity, offering $38.5 million for a 15-month  contract.  Failing to disclose to other bidders -- except El Paso Merchant -- that  another affiliated company would soon offer discounted rates for use of an  interconnection line extending from Topock into Southern California.  Testifying before the Assembly committee, El Paso officials scoffed at the  suggestion that their auction for pipeline capacity was rigged.  The minimum price set for the pipeline space -- $37.5 million -- was a fair  one. Auction terms stipulated the capacity would be parceled out if the total  of all small bids exceeded the highest ""total package"" bid, the officials  noted.  There was nothing unusual about the El Paso affiliate, Mojave, offering a  discount to its interconnection line. The line wasn't crucial to bidders. And  all companies had the same opportunity to inquire about discount  possibilities prior to submitting bids, the officials said.  Attorney Peggy Heeg, an El Paso corporate vice president, said FERC strictly  regulates relationships among affiliates. But it doesn't ban the types of  rate discussions that an unrelated company might have with the corporation,  she said.  El Paso firms would and could not collude with each other to discourage  competition, Heeg said.  ""(Affiliates) have to operate completely independently -- even if they have  the same shareholders,"" she said. ",dasovich-j

I was sensing that she was  frustrated.    Anil is also less extroverted, but based on discussions with him, I think  that he is less concerned because he has some other pretty cosmic things on  his plate right now.

Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps,  investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back  de-regulation, to name a few.    Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled  about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that  from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this  session is a fairly high priority?

4234,"Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before  the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking  into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).    The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up  on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned  power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star  witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and  Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their  message was simple (and simplistic):  El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas  at the border (to ""obscene"" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.  Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide  the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets  any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty,  but it provides the basics.  Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to  offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California  Legislature is peddling.  Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the  California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis  when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of  the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

4242,"This is a very good synopsis of the gas crimes trials in California.  Pleas= e=20 note comments of Assembly Republican John Campbell---perhaps the sole brigh= t=20 spot in the California Legislature...  Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation  Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20 California Assembly has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the= =20 state=01,s current energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane= d=20 heavily on a report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility= =20 Southern California Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.  But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu= ral=20 Gas -- is not ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i= t=20 recently presented as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.  As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP= UC=20 are pointing the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde= r=20 prices through affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against = El=20 Paso is The Brattle Group=01,s study of the California market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor= t=20 presented to legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence= =20 of factors, not a conspiracy, caused the price run-up.  Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa= so=20 to conduct work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20 concluded that the increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the= =20 main culprits in the California gas price imbroglio.  Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,= =20 said he ""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.  ""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20 Study and a little on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20 legislature is the best place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20 said. ""I believe FERC is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the= =20 appropriate place.""  Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to= =20 give support to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20 basically by the Public Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20 pipeline companies to push up gas prices in California, he said.  The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission.""  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.  The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily= =20 litigated effort to force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20 participants. Following on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out= =20 The Brattle Group report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20 major pipelines that serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.  Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the= =20 requested data contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20 process to move forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting= =20 access to evidence (GD 4/23).  Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their= =20 case. The commission recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a= =20 large block of pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20 addressing the California Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th= e=20 California border controversy obviated the need for more investigation.  The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a= =20 hearing into whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv= e=20 up the price of gas delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place= =20 this summer. (RP00- 241, et al.) NH",dasovich-j

Only other comment:  I'm not sure that, technically/contractually, we entered  into transactions with the PX (in the same way that I don't think that folks  enter into transactions with NYMEX).  (See opening line of last paragraph.)    We have exposure to thePX based on our commercial activity that took place  through the PX, and that exposure depends on how the PX /FERC decide  particular issues.  In short, we have transactions with the utilities, and  exposure to the PX based on transactions that we entered into with other  counter parties via the PX market mechanism.  That said, seems to me that,  for the purposes of the disclosure, the language is fine---just want to raise  the flag. Might be useful to run it by Richard Sanders.  Hope this helps.

4285,"10,000 creditors seek PG&E billions  Confidential list reveals each vendor's claim  David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, April 26, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/26/M N229624.DTL  The plight of PG&E's vast array of business partners, many of which are owed  millions of dollars, is made painfully clear in a confidential list of  creditors now being compiled for the utility's bankruptcy proceedings.  A copy of the list, obtained by The Chronicle, illustrates the impact of the  third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on PG&E's thousands of vendors.  This also is the first time the monetary value is being revealed for each  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. contract.  ""It's going to be a cat fight,"" said Cathy Moran, a Mountain View bankruptcy  attorney. ""They'll be fighting over a limited pot of money, and each party  will be seeking preferential treatment.""  The $9 billion owed by the utility to its more than 10,000 creditors  constitutes the largest-ever bankruptcy involving a utility. The need to keep  California's lights on adds a virtually unprecedented level of complexity to  the proceedings.  Companies on the creditor list run the gamut from huge to tiny. IBM Corp. and  Pacific Bell are joined by the likes of Pete's Auto Body Shop in Merced and  Sponges Car Wash in San Ramon.  ""We provide gas and electricity to 13 million people,"" said Ron Low, a PG&E  spokesman. ""Behind all the poles and wires are thousands of employees and the  thousands of vendors who support them.""  He said every department at the utility had spent weeks pulling together  information for the creditor list, to be submitted to Bankruptcy Judge Dennis  Montali by mid-May.  'REPAY ALL OUR CREDITORS'  ""We've had to look at all the contracts we have with companies and  individuals,"" Low said. ""It is our intention to repay all our creditors.""  Whether the various creditors receive all, some or none of the cash owed them  will be determined once a reorganization plan is worked out, perhaps years  down the road.  The Bankruptcy Court will contact all PG&E creditors and invite them to  submit what is known as a ""proof of claim"" -- evidence that the creditor  indeed is owed money.  This is a matter taken very seriously by San Martin's Allwaste  Transportation, a chemical disposal firm, which relies on PG&E for about a  quarter of its total revenues.  As it happened, an Allwaste technician was pumping hazardous waste out of  PG&E's Humboldt Bay power plant near Eureka at the exact same time that the  utility was filing for bankruptcy protection on April 6.  Payment for that service, as with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of  other jobs, is now in limbo as a result of PG&E's bankruptcy.  'THEY STUCK WITH US'  ""PG&E is very important to us,"" said Lee Soares, Allwaste's operations  manager. ""This is definitely a hit.""  He added, however, that his company would stand behind the utility. ""They  stuck with us when we went bankrupt,"" Soares acknowledged.  Many of PG&E's creditors reflect the utility's core operations. For example,  the list contains numerous affiliates involved with power poles, trimming  trees around electricity lines or laying pipes for natural gas transmission.  Meanwhile, other creditors speak to the nuts and bolts of running a business  with 21,500 workers and far-reaching activities.  If a PG&E truck is involved in a fender-bender in the East Bay, it might be  taken to The Masters body shop in Hayward, which has a contract with the  utility valued at $28,800.  ""We do a lot of work for them,"" said co-owner Jan Masters. ""We'd miss the  account if they stopped coming.""  That hasn't happened yet. Masters said PG&E had continued bringing its  vehicles to her two-person shop since the bankruptcy filing. So far, the  utility has paid its bills promptly.  ""They don't get the vehicle back if we don't get paid,"" Masters noted.  One of the most prominent creditors on PG&E's list is Hertz Equipment Rental  Corp. The utility's $13 million contract makes it Hertz's single biggest  corporate client in the Bay Area and one of its largest in the nation.  500 PAYMENTS DUE HERTZ  According to the creditor list, PG&E has nearly 500 payments for various  equipment and vehicle rentals outstanding with Hertz. The individual  transactions range in value from as much as $97,539 to as little as $1.  ""We provide a lot of equipment for them, heavy construction equipment to  build things,"" said Diana Kirby, who handles the PG&E account at Hertz's  Rohnert Park headquarters. ""Basically, they couldn't afford to purchase all  the items they rent from us.  ""Their filing for bankruptcy will have a large impact on us,"" she added. ""But  we'll weather the storm. What else can we do?""  That's the dilemma facing all PG&E creditors, large and small. A select  committee of the utility's largest creditors will seek to represent other  vendors during the bankruptcy proceedings.  In typical Chapter 11 cases, this arrangement tends to work smoothly for all  concerned. But in a case as sprawling and complicated as PG&E's  reorganization, there is a possibility that the interests of smaller  creditors can get lost in the shuffle.  The bankruptcy judge could seek to simplify things by addressing the claims  of PG&E's smaller creditors first, thus reducing the size of the playing  field when the big guys begin duking it out.  ""This case is going to write its own rules,"" predicted Moran, the bankruptcy  lawyer. ""You've got a very large number of dollars and the public interest  involved.""  STRANGE BEDFELLOWS You also have a situation in which PG&E's financial demise has made  bedfellows of companies and individuals that might otherwise have never  crossed paths.  Xerox Corp. now stands arm-in-arm with Hayward's A-1 Septic Tank Service.  Enterprise Rent-A-Car is a comrade of Modesto's Jack Frost Ice Service.  Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto has more than 40 claims outstanding for  computer services ranging in value from $22 to $72,583. But the company  already is looking ahead to new deals.  ""PG&E has been a good customer,"" said Randy Lane, an H P spokesman. ""We would  expect that, after the proceedings are done, they'll continue to be a good  customer.""  On the other hand, freelance photographer Steve Castillo in Menlo Park has a  contract with PG&E valued at $25,000 to shoot pictures for the utility's in-  house newsletter. That was when times were good.  ""I assume I'm not going to get any more calls from them,"" Castillo said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20 assembly when it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus= t on=20 natural gas but on other things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the= =20 finger elsewhere for the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein= g some=20 of that with the public utilities commission.""  Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20 prices is a different matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se= em=20 to have taken on a life of their own.

4381,"Subject: LADWP, BC Hydro, Bonneville Accused of Gouging California  Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too   Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices  up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation.   By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers  ????Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels  that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and  fall, according to public and confidential records.  ?????For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have  chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into  darkness and economic chaos.  ?????But they are just part of the equation.  ?????A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that  have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does  identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for  the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized  profits in the volatile spot market.  ?????The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a  recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently  trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville  Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's  BC Hydro in British Columbia.  ?????Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers  offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when  the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three  largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas  & Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week.  ?????The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO,  analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in  the spot, or ""real-time,"" market from May to November. The study accounted  for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of  scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market.  ?????Money earned above that was called excess profits.  ?????No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits  as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show.  ?????""They were the most aggressive bidders,"" said Anjali Sheffrin, author of  the coded study.  ?????""They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,""  said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name.  ?????The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive  profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private  generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy  Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged  inflated earnings.  ?????BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they  played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan  and did not exploit the state's troubles.  ?????But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of  severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise  overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be  produced inexpensively but sold for a premium.  ?????""It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity  would be at any given time,"" said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. ""We  helped keep the lights on in California.""  ?????And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC  Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a ""rainy day"" account to  ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America.  ?????Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list  of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices  during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire  spot market, where emergency purchases are made.  ?????This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power  at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest  increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them  from falling.  ?????The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity  ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston  and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy  market.  ?????In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that  could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said,  referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. ""The data shows they  clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load  conditions.""  ?????DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings  ""outrageous,"" insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices.  ?????""These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes  unpunished in this state,"" Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert  more blackouts across the state.  ?????He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for  surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to  produce.  ?????""We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%,"" he said.  ""It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down  their throats.""  ?????Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never  took it personally. ""If you're innocent,"" he said, ""you don't look at the  criminal file.""  ?????Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's  deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration,  a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal  dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin.  ?????Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but  reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it  supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was  in the top five accused of taking excessive profits.  ?????Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back  federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon  recovery program.  ?????Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act  improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached  its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading  for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices.  ?????""From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we  operated precisely within the terms of their rules,"" Oliver said.  ?????Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so  distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act  responsibly, has bailed out.  ?????It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier  studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138,  the highest.  ?????But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers  offering power received the highest price paid in any hour.  ?????The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to  sell at a single-digit price.  ?????""They weren't the culprits,"" said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. ""Someone else  drove that up.""  ?????Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California  market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he  said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings.  ?????""We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,""  he said.  ?????The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the  price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because  the overall prices are still excessive.  ?????""We're saying the patient is sick,"" Sheffrin said of California's  electricity market. ""It needs help [and] may die.""  ?????   ",dasovich-j

4420,"Greetings Laura and Marybeth:  Laura: If you have the time and the inclination, I'd like to spend a half-hour  briefing you on the energy situation.  I apologize for the brevity of this  note, but can fill you in more if you think that there's value in chatting.  In a nutshell, there's a concerted effort underway----one last big push----to  try to get a comprehensive solution in place for California that works for  the majority of constituencies (i.e., broad coalition right and left of  center).  The deal would be bi-partisan.  If successful, the deal would:  Put rates in place that reflect and cover costs, repay debts, send the right  price signals for efficiency, but fall short of ""shock therapy."" Return the utility to creditworthiness as a result of the new rates. Use the minimum amount of State- and utility-backed bonds to finance the  solution Turn the procurement role back over to the utilities (and away from the  State) once creditworthiness is established---3-6 months following the rate  changes. Establish the competitive market structure that California was promised but  never got---consumer choice for all customers; 18-24 months later, large  industrial would be required to procure electricity needs from the market. NOT include government takeovers of the industry (e.g., sale of utility  transmission assets to the State would not be part of any deal). Include a contribution from large players, e.g., utilities and suppliers. Resolve the myriad lawsuits, investigations, etc.  Those involved still believe that there is a need for a group of ""wise  persons"" to help get the deal done.  L. Summers is willing; others are being  considered.  Your name has come up.  But that issue can be addressed later.   The goal of a phone call would be to bring you up to speed on the events,  which are breaking quickly.  Hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.

Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with  him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.

4463,"Met early this morning with Jack Steward (pres. of CMA) and Keith McCrea  (lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them  regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:  They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power  purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut. McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to  go the market?""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for  core/noncore has a lot of merit. Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when  the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore)  should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core  customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates  the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would  not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them,  in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects  would be and would share it with them when we're done. While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful  to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the  necessary support to get passed.  They are also withholding final judgment  until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do. They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are  extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge  and Loretta Lynch.  They place very little trust in the Governor or the  Legislature. Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento  for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to  CMA. Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to  commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.",dasovich-j

Core and noncore are responsible for the ""DWR past purchases"" (spread over 15  years). Core will keep IOU gen, QFs and DWR contracts (which would eliminate the  short for the core) Noncore, in return for giving up the lucrative IOU gen, effectively accepts  the short position (i.e., goes to market) AND does not get sacked with DWR's  going forward costs (with ""forward costs"" defined as all power costs  attributable to the ""post-core/noncore"" transition date.

Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on  the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.  Best, Jeff  SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of  the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the  calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take  the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and  advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible  process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for  however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of  next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be  brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of   market structure for  electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation,  etc.  Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that  discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)",dasovich-j

4634,"PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on  Redwood, Baja and Silverado. It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into  California by pipelines. The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the  original Gas Accord. The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31. Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03. Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what  generators want). Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will  expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03,  or some time during Q103. About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed    date. The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual)  on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado. How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might  auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing. No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any  specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level  of capacity they choose).

Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including  members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.   Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy  campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the  governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new  director of communications.   Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.   Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a  year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis'  spokesman. McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal  regulators and with generators.   Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the  Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.   Fluckiger is ""on loan"" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers,  Maviglio said.  -- Associated Press  ",dasovich-j

4660,"Power shortage shifts attitudes  Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001  BY NOAM LEVEY  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy  and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically  shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new  poll shows.  Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the  wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly  two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to  the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California.  And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose  approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in  January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll.  ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in  the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most  surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very  dramatic.''  Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting  Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide.  Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important  issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and  6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In  recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top  issue.  And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply,  demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great  deal.''  ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and  without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a  46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose.  Results dismissed  The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as  predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with  anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken  in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very  hard to communicate that in this state.''  South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of  Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected  to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including  Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis  also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004.  The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current  electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are  culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who  blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's  landmark deregulation five years ago.  ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's  legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose.  Criticism for Davis  But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading  California out of its power troubles.  Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling  the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the  governor for not doing more.  Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis  involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to  control the price that California is being forced to pay for power.  The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for  the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of  words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support  price caps on electricity.  Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and  focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power.  The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of  Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the  crisis.  But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18  percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8  percent favored federal price controls on generators.  That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who  have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of  power to mine the California market for excessive profits.  ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the  price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the  Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that  price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants.  Backing re-regulation  Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the  electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will  come when Californians' power bills start rising next month.  ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off  the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for  Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to  face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people  understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the  only solution will be re-regulation.''  Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear,  however.  ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people  view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the  Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the  state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people  worry.  ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined  public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''",dasovich-j

4669,"Hertzberg called.  We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us  to build for him.  I've attached the file.  the supporting spreadsheets are  not included.  If folks would like them, let me know.  Please keep the file  confidential.    Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers  if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to  noncore customers.   Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases  when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to  businesess (i.e., to noncore).  (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is  below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates  significantly above the Lynch rates.   Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that  it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by  the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates  again soon.  In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which  will require yet additional increases. I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or  tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put  100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive  market and out from under Loretta). I will report back after we've spoken. All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome  and appreciated.  Best, Jeff  ",dasovich-j

Hertzberg asked for, and we provided  today, a ""fifth scenario,"" which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of  core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.  It's attached.

4737,"Status of core/noncore proposal Buzz about the proposal in Sacramento is still significant and growing. Our name is being tossed about, but in the context (apparently) of ""some  parts of Enron's core/noncore proposal."" Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.  Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors) They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats  IOU past due) using their MOU numbers. They said that the model ""can work"" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this  is pretty consistent with our analysis). Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me  the results tomorrow AM. Hertzberg is coming up with ""additional"" twists, however. The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates  down). Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market can't/won't swallow $20B of  additional debt (the MOU would issue about $13B). In addition, Hertzberg wants to stretch it out for 20 years (the MOU would  issues 15-year paper)----Hoffman and Co. are concerned that the market won't  buy 20-year paper. Hoffman & Co. continue to work on the DWR creditworthiness issue (if not done  by July, they'll lose the contracts they've signed, which have out clauses in  the event that credit isn't in place by July)  Conversation with the Chamber The Chamber of Commerce called and I re-iterated (again) the key features of  our core/noncore proposal (as opposed to other features being tossed about,  e.g., cost-shifting).

4749,"Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt  Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief Thursday, May 31, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/31/M N231235.DTL  Sacramento -- Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern  California Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at  the expense of its biggest customers.  The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial  customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion  back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users  would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt.  Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but  supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and  should shoulder the costs it created.  ""We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these  problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any  problems,"" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County).  Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put  Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help  restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency.  Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP  lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt.  The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into ""core"" and  ""noncore"" users.  SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core  users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would  be those using more than 500 kilowatts.  Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers.  But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy.  Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, long-  term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and solar  panels, on contract with the utility.  That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of  the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of  electricity.  Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to  buy their power directly from generators or build on-site power plants to  make themselves energy self-sufficient.  The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy  customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market.  During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users  would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would  shift exclusively to the big users.  Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be  given what is called ""direct access"" to generators so they can negotiate  cheaper rates.  Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users  because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells.  Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so.  EDISON 'ENCOURAGED' Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out  details of the plan.  A spokesman for Edison said he was ""encouraged"" by the talks.  ""I haven't seen a finished product or a plan,"" said Bob Foster, a senior vice  president with Edison. ""They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and  trying to find a solution.""  Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there  is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity.  ""We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will  experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years,"" said D.J. Smith, a  lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association.  ""When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another  potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy,""  Smith said.  Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and  Technology Association: ""What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying  the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics.  They don't want voters to pay because they vote.""  CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights,  said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business  interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto  residential and smaller commercial customers.  ""I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public  Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big  business end up costing more for residential and small businesses,""  Rosenfield said.  The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of  the transmission system that loops electricity around the state.  Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that  for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value.  Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state  purchase of transmission lines.  In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the  transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset.  In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to  either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities,  for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

4750,"Municipal utilities warned  Governor says he'll seize excess electricity if prices don't come down  David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Thursday, May 31, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/31/MN154796.DTL  Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis threatened last night to seize excess power  generated by California's municipal utility districts, which he said have  charged even higher electricity prices than out-of-state generators.  Davis said in an interview with The Chronicle that some municipal utility  districts have charged the state as much as 10 percent more than the average  wholesale cost demanded by private power companies.  The governor's tough talk came as California suffered through a Stage 2 power  alert and faced the prospect of a long, hot summer of rolling blackouts and  skyrocketing electricity prices. So far this year, the state has paid more  than $8.2 billion to buy power for its cash-strapped utilities.  In a variation on his threat to seize power plants from out-of-state  generators if they continue gouging California ratepayers, the governor said  he would use his executive powers to claim excess juice from the locally  owned utilities if they do not lower their prices.  He said he is ready to go to court if they offer resistance.  ""We're going to get that power one way or another,"" Davis said.  Municipal utilities are city-owned power companies. In Northern California,  there are municipal utilities in Alameda, Palo Alto, Redding, Sacramento and  Santa Clara. Los Angeles has the largest municipal utility in the state.  30 DAYS TILL CONTRACT DETAILS  For the first time, the governor also gave a time frame for releasing details  of more than 40 long-term electricity contracts California is signing with  generators since the financial meltdown of the state's two biggest utilities.  He said that after about six more contracts get nailed down, he expects full  details to be made available within 30 days.  Although the contracts involve nearly $40 billion in public funds, Davis and  other state officials have adamantly refused to divulge their contents,  insisting that secrecy is needed to remain competitive during negotiations.  The Chronicle and other media outlets have filed suit for access to the  contracts, arguing that the public has a right to know how its money is being  spent.  RUDE AWAKENING While going toe-to-toe with the out-of-state generators, the last thing Davis  needed was for municipal utilities -- the home team, as it were -- to emulate  the Texas big boys and dig deep into California's pockets.  Yet the governor's negotiators have been struggling for weeks to convince  municipals that they are obliged to provide power at cost -- which Davis  insisted they are required to do by law.  He met last week with the heads of a dozen municipal utilities and told them  explicitly that he would not tolerate gouging from within the state as  California faces a summer of potential blackouts.  The governor said after the meeting that the municipals had agreed ""to make  most of their excess power available this summer . . . at prices  significantly lower than those being charged on the spot market.""  Apparently, however, little progress has been made since that declaration.  Davis told The Chronicle last night that he is still ""trying very hard to  promote this notion that we're all in this together.""  While unwilling to specify which municipal utilities have been most  aggressive in their pricing, and refusing to place a dollar amount on how  much the utilities charged, Davis said he is prepared to seize up to 800  megawatts of output if the they do not change their ways.  Eight hundred megawatts is enough power to light about 800,000 homes.  Representatives of the various municipal utilities could not be reached for  comment, nor could a spokesperson for the California Municipal Utilities  Association in Sacramento.  ""I told them that they will either (reduce their prices) voluntarily or  involuntarily,"" the governor said.  UNCERTAIN FUTURE It remains to be seen, however, whether the municipal utilities will play  ball. To date, they have shown a firm inclination to go their own way.  In March, Lodi's municipal utility district and a Northern California  municipal utility cooperative that includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and  Alameda told Pacific Gas and Electric Co. that they will not participate in  rolling blackouts during power shortages.  ""I won't arbitrarily screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can  turn on their lights somewhere else,"" said Alan Vallow, director of the  utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents.

4762,"FYI.  Did we talk to Leopold?  Might be useful to stress that that under  noncore/core (like Direct Access), customers choose from among a host of  competing providers for their service, not just Enron.  Best, Jeff    California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue  By Jason Leopold  ?  18:00 ET  Dow Jones Business News  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Dow Jones Newswires  LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for  rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would  be on the hook.  In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied  efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering  ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers  to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this  week.  The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly  Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape  as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so  ""desperate"" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California  Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into  bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse  residential consumers out of the equation.  ""The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for  deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing  out Edison,"" the aide said. ""We're looking to take the burden off of  residential ratepayers.""  The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is  to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as  non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500  kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of  power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale  market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its  $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills.  Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market  as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate  themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts.  Enron Pushing Access to Customers  Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks  to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California  Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its  residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs.  Burton and Hertzberg said.  An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to  Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial  customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has  recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the  California Chamber of Commerce.  Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with  companies like Enron for their power.  Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was  scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in  place of the utilities.  The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as  alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in  April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle  reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who  have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement  forward.

Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to  Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and  met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss  solutions to California's electricity crisis.  But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's  San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's  past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses.

4768,"Municipal utilities lambaste Davis threat to seize power  David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Friday, June 1, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/01/MN17670.DTL  California municipal utilities reacted with shock and anger yesterday to Gov.  Gray Davis' threat to seize their excess power if they did not slash prices  to below-market rates.  ""I feel totally betrayed,"" said George Fraser, general manager of the  Northern California Power Agency, an association of 14 municipal utilities.  ""It's clear to me that the governor doesn't understand the power business.""  This new dimension to the state's energy woes came as authorities issued  their first one-hour warning of imminent blackouts in the Bay Area, only to  cancel the warning an hour later when additional power supplies were found.  Davis told The Chronicle in an interview Wednesday that some city-owned  municipal utilities had charged even higher electricity prices than the  out-of- state generators he has accused of gouging California consumers.  He said he was prepared to use his executive authority ""to get that power one  way or another"" if the utilities did not lower their prices. The state so far  has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity on behalf of cash- strapped  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.  ""What the governor said makes no sense whatsoever,"" said Jerry Jordan,  executive director of the California Municipal Utilities Association. ""He was  definitely off-base.""  Jordan said most municipal utilities already provided all surplus power to  California's electricity market.  However, he said, the municipals buy power at market rates to meet their own  shortfalls, and thus have a responsibility to their customers -- local city  residents -- to sell any excess supplies at the same sky-high price levels.  ""Our utilities are going to do what they can to help the state of  California,"" Jordan said. ""But they aren't going to do that at the expense of  customers.""  Davis' threat followed a meeting last week with the heads of about a dozen  municipal utilities. Participants said the tone of the discussion was  generally cordial, and it was understood the governor's office would work up  a plan for future electricity purchases.  Davis' threat came out of the blue, they said.  ""We're willing to sell our excess power,"" said John Roukema, assistant  director of Silicon Valley Power in Santa Clara. ""But we have to deal with  the same market conditions that the governor does.""  Davis doesn't see it that way. He believes that many municipal utilities are  exploiting California's power shortage in the same way that out-of-state  generators are walking off with billions of dollars in windfall profits.  The governor's top energy adviser, S. David Freeman, said in an interview  yesterday that Davis' threat to seize the municipals' power was intended as a  reminder that the state expected prompt action on the issue.  ""We want to be sure that the municipals are not just talking the talk but  doing what they say,"" Freeman said.  He said municipal utilities should be selling surplus power at the same level  it cost to generate electricity, plus a reasonable markup of about 15  percent.  Freeman finds himself in a somewhat awkward position on the matter. Before  signing on with the Davis administration, he was head of the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power, by far the state's largest municipal utility.  The Los Angeles department has been accused by both federal and state  officials of charging some of the highest prices of all for electricity.  Earlier this year, it was asking as much as $1,400 per megawatt hour for its  output.  Frank Salas, the department's chief operating officer, said such prices were  necessitated by high production expenses. ""We were just recovering our  costs,"" he said.  For his part, Freeman insisted that no such pricing had occurred on his  watch.  ""There was tremendous pressure on me to charge more,"" he said of urgings from  Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other local officials for higher  profits, demands that Freeman said he had resisted.  ""That pressure may have increased now that I'm gone,"" he said. ""I don't know  what they're doing now.""  The Department of Water and Power's Salas countered that Freeman should know  exactly what his former colleagues were doing. ""We have the same pricing  structure now that we had when he was boss,"" he said.  Fraser at the Northern California Power Agency said it was strange that Davis  would be so aggressive in his dealings with the municipals, which provide  only about 15 percent of the state's power needs.  ""He's kicking the little guy,"" he said. ""He's picking on us because he can.""  E-mail David Lazarus at  ",dasovich-j

4818,"I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I  can't recall, I'm sending to all.  First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet  Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized  her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the  ""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email,  and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The  answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the  report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).    My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez  that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a  fatal flaw--significant probability.)  Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable  variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the  answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet,  beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)  Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with  something remotely similar.

4828,"Couple of thoughts:  In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems  that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to  a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the  pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a  way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act  in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding  the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for  coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that  he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having  the adminstration cook up something less preferable.",dasovich-j

You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according  to my records) for over $25,000.  As you recall, we had a very lengthy  discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings  and associated briefs.  I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that  we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I  pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset.  With that in mind, I  believe that it's important to honor the arrangement.  However, in light of  the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous  arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that.

Same  goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may  influence where we eat).  Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys.

4929,"Greetings:  Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time,  we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail,  etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes  of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If  any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can  forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled  a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM  (PDT).  A Little Background: Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of  California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis  Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea  at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km. At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN. At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two,  separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP. Will deploy DWDM. Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific  systems. In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes  a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF  and Monterey. Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial  leg). Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego  to create a complete loop. Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC  certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from  Coastal Commission. Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo)  built and lit by end of Q1 2001.   Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with  federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey  altogether. The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless""  when it comes to marketing the capacity. Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in  (per Ethan's emails). They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them. Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX  prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched.   The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices  will force the QFs that have switched to ""refund"" some of the payments  they've received (e.g., under a ""PX minus"" mechanism).  The majority of QFs  are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except  those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit).

In short, ENA wants to offer a  complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small  commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service  for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets  (upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's    services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E  that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the  immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

4960,"FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the  street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the  ""misconduct"" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney  thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the ""unnamed"" trader in the  Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.   Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  ""The same people who colluded in  the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.""  No  idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:  Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that  Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state  (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed ""Czar"" by the State of  California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain  child (AB 1890).

5077,"Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that  didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.  The description of  the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on  sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.  $100 cap for ""old"" generation; ""new"" generation would be exempt. FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of  their power. For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100  cap, and the $250 cap will apply. Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled  gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward  market. Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market  will be penalized (details to be ""ironed"" out).  The ISO is supposed to make the filing at FERC today.",dasovich-j

Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants  to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on  board. Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to  consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later  today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting. The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous  ""prudence"" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts. Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting. Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an  objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do  worse, they take the hit.  The utility, under this framework, has broad  flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.  (FYI:   Coincidentally, I suggested this approach in very broad terms--pointing to  the fact that it's already successfully in use on the gas side--during a  panel discussion that I participated in yesterday at the California Energy  Markets conference.) The utilities told Rod Wright that they did not want, nor did they have the  expertise, to get back into the generation business.",dasovich-j

5196,"FYI.  How to remedy the ""PX only"" flaw in California's market has been on the  table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a  good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to  the current framework.    As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy  Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also  spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go  up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other  options--with him.    My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the  Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a  very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for  PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.

5235,"Dave Parquet and I spoke with Smutney of IEP re: herding the cats.  In true ""swedish hostage syndrome"" fashion, Smutney informed us that none of  IEP's members has screamed about the FERC-proposed cap.  He added that the  ""industry"" is under siege and that ""just saying no"" to price caps isn't  politically tenable.  He also said that he hadn't planned on mentioning price  caps in his remarks.  We expressed concern that it would be hard for the head  of California's generator association to avoid the topic.  We stressed the importance of having IEP disagree with FERC's cap proposal  and offered the following message points:  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms  necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for  price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to  undermine ""high"" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e.,  similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs  profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the  benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works.   The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of ""after-the-fact""  reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning,  efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the  proposed cap.  Smutney was comfortable with these points and is open to hearing more from us  today and tomorrow.  If folks have comments on these points, or have others  we should discuss with Smutney, don't hesitate.  Best, Jeff",dasovich-j

5243,"Steve:  I'm not sure how far along you are with the comments, but California's  insistence on micro-managing utility purchases is really standing in the way  of developing a competitive, functional market.  The prospect of having Ms.  Lynch in particular and the State of California generally as a counter party  in every transaction is a huge disincentive for the utilities to transact.   (Though the situation in California has now put the utilities into a ""damn  the torpedoes"" mode and persuaded them to transaction despite the regulatory  risk.)  Clearly, the first best answer is utility-out-of-the-merchant-function.  But  given the political climate in California, we're likely to have the utility  in the role of buyer, at least in the near term.  For the market to work in a  structure with utility as buyer, the CPUC and California need to get out of  the way. Otherwise, it's a never-ending quagmire.  A couple of PUCs ago, the CPUC set up an incentive mechanism for utility gas  procurement.  Under that mechanism, a benchmark is set.  If the utility beats  the benchmark, it shares the benefits with consumers.  If it does worse than  the benchmark, it shares the pain with consumers.  It's a model that works,  that's simple and that's compatible with competitive markets.  It ain't  perfect, but it's head and shoulders above the regulator-as-counterparty that  the current PUC has put in place.  Given the brief time you'll have, there may be other more critical issues,  but this one is getting increasing attention out here in the land of lunacy.

5248,"Here's a start.  Try 'em out for size.  More to follow.  Best, Jeff  Price caps have failed in the past and they'll fail again. FERC's and California's immediate goal ought to be to make the bold reforms  necessary to create real, competitive markets and eliminate the need for  price caps altogether. The most important reforms include: Reforming California's siting laws to permit entry of supply---best way to  undermine ""high"" prices is easy entry by competitors Reforming the PUC review of utility purchases Give the utilities financial incentives to purchase efficiently (i.e.,  similar to California's gas market, where a benchmark is set and the IOUs  profit or lose on the basis of whether the IOU does better or worse than the  benchmark).  It ain't rocket science, and it works.   The CPUC gets out of the way and stops the practice of ""after-the-fact""  reviews of power purchases. Creating a retail market If California/FERC adopt these reforms, the need for caps will vanish. FERC got a lot right in the order, but the price cap proposal is flawed. Price is too low to incent development of peakers---well-functioning,  efficient markets require peakers. Information disclosure provisions are too costly and unnecessary. Disincents energy efficiency. IEP written comments will offer suggestions on how to remedy the flaws in the  proposed cap.",dasovich-j

As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts,  longs for the ""halcyon days"" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I  think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the  effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.    In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed  experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day,  who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal  settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's  proposal is attached.

In my continual pursuit for wine nirvana,  I have traveled to Bordeaux and back with stops in Italy and Australia and  for what?

Aristocratically structured the 1997 Opus One  magnificently perfumes the air with aromas of ripe, succulent fruit,  fragrant, sweet earth and delicate, white flowers. Persistent to the point of  perfection, this wine does not allow its captive audience to escape its web  of Cabernet ecstasy. Made with the five important varietals of Bordeaux (82%  Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Cabernet Franc, 5% Merlot, 4% Malbec, and 1% Petit  Verdot), this spellbinding wine commands attention.

If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL:   http://gspp.berkeley.edu/events/electricity_summit_conference.htm.  I'm on the ""summit's"" second panel: ""What do we do now?""  I've been asked to  identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the  solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC).  There are two documents.  One is a document that I previously distributed and  used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week.  The  other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum.  I have 5-10  meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the  ""facilitator.""  All comments are appreciated.  Best, Jeff ",dasovich-j

5337,"That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her.   In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators  as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll  look into setting up a meeting with her.  Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is  still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the  ""undercollection/refund"" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move  ahead.    Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's  likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control  Peace at her hearings.

5338,"Mona and I plan to be in Sacramento tomorrow at an AB 1890 Implementation  Group meeting.  I think that Sue also has a conflict.  My thought was to have  someone from the PR firm that Karen has brought on go and report back.  I'm  supposed to give a presentation on gas tomorrow, but it's not a problem for  me to cancel and go to S.D. if we think that it's vital for one of us to be  there in person.   Thoughts?

5339,"Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil  and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that  includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I  suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc.  that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal  issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing  something, please let me know.  Thoughts?    	Harry Kingerski 	 ",dasovich-j

5348,"Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday.  Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far  as to push the ""core/noncore"" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you  just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I  am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:  I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility  should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act  as a ""quasi-governmental"" body offering reliable, low cost service to small  customers. I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive  market willy nilly. People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of  the ""good"" power, leaving the ""dregs"" for small customers.  While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but  there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening  that we should try to exploit.  In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas  model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of  attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the  utility live or die by the benchmark.  There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of  uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the  Legislature will get on board.

5350,"As uncomfortable as it sometimes is, I feel compelled to comment on what in  my humble opinion are quite troubling statements, particularly when those  statements come from the mouths of self-described liberal, open minded,  diversity-loving hipsters.  I have a very hard time with stereotyping of any  sort, and a very, very hard time when it comes from people I'm close to.   Believe it or not, in the past, I would have been much more aggressive about  it.  Guess I've mellowed.  Sorry if it made things, well, fidgety.  (I've  come to grips with the fact that deep down, I tend to trend toward socially  libertarian and sometimes even anarchist views---oh well.)  Best, Jeff    	  < ",dasovich-j

5365,"FYI.  Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity  group yesterday.  The group was formed out of California's restructuring  legislation (AB 1980).  It's called the ""AB 1980 Implementation Group"" (I  heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).  The group  includes just about all of the interest groups in California.    I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a ""real"" market that  California should look to in order to fix the ""artificial"" and failed  electricity model created by AB 1980.
