a bbs for text file junkies rpgnet gm file archive site the adveniure of the three gables i dont think that any of my adventures with mr sherlock holmes opened quite so abruptly or so dramatically as that which i associate with the three gables
i had not seen holmes for some days and had no idea of the new channel into which his activities had been directed
he was in a chatty mood that morning however and had just settled me into the wellworn low armchair on one side of the fire while he had curled down with his pipe in his mouth upon the opposite chair when our visitor arrived
if i had said that a mad bull had arrived it would give a clearer impression of what occurred
the door had flown open and a huge negro had burst into the room
he would have been a comic figure if he had not been terrific for he was dressed in a very loud gray check suit with a flowing salmoncoloured tie
his broad face and flattened nose were thrust forward as his sullen dark eyes with a smouldering gleam of malice in them turned from one of us to the other
holmes raised his pipe with a languid smile
pleasant stealthy step round the angle of the table
see here masser holmes you keep your hands out of other folks busi ness
leave folks to manage their own affairs
got that masser holmes
damn fine if i have to trim you up a bit
ive handled your kind before now and they didnt look fine when i was through with them
look at that masser holmes
he swung a huge knotted lump of a fist under my friends nose
holmes examined it closely with an air of great interest
it may have been the icy coolness of my friend or it may have been the slight clatter which i made as i picked up the poker
in any case our visitors manner became less flamboyant
thats interested out harrow way  you know what im meaning  and he dont intend to have no buttin in by you
got that
you aint the law and i aint the law either and if you come in ill be on hand also
dont you forget it
wont ask you to sit down for i dont like the smell of you but arent you steve dixie the bruiser
it for sure if you give me any lip
at our visitors hideous mouth
but it was the killing of young perkins outside the holborn  bar what
youre not going
the negro had sprung back and his face was leaden
i wont listen to no such talk said he
what have i to do with this ere perkins masser holmes
i was trainin at the bull ring in birmingham when this boy done gone get into trouble
you
feelins about this ere visit
that same genlman that you have just done gone mention
safe if he go down harrow way
thats the whole truth
without waiting for any further questioning our visitor bolted out of the room almost as precipitately as he had entered
holmes knocked out the ashes of his pipe with a quiet chuckle
watson
i observed your manoeuvres with the poker
but he is really rather a harmless fellow a great muscular foolish blus tering baby and easily cowed as you have seen
he is one of the spencer john gang and has taken part in some dirty work of late which i may clear up when i have time
his immediate principal barney is a more astute person
they specialize in assaults intimidation and the like
what i want to know is who is at the back of them on this panicular occasion
matter for if it is worth anyones while to take so much trouble there must be something in it
here is mrs maberleys note
if you care to come with me we will wire her and go out at once
dear mr sherlock holmes i read i have had a succession of strange incidents occur to me in connection with this house and i should much value your advice
you would find me at home any time tomorrow
the house is within a short walk of the weald station
i believe that my late husband mortimer maberley was one of your early clients
yours faithfully mary maberley
the address was the three gables harrow weald
the time watson we will get upon our way
a short railway journey and a shorter drive brought us to the house a brick and timber villa standing in its own acre of undeveloped grassland
three small projections above
the upper windows made a feeble attempt to justify its name
behind was a grove of melancholy halfgrown pines and the whole aspect of the place was poor and depressing
none the less we found the house to be well furnished and the lady who received us was a most engaging elderly person who bore every mark of refine ment and culture
trifling matter
son douglas
holmes looked at her with great interest
him slightly
but of course all london knew him
what a magnificent creature he was
where is he now
died there of pneumonia last month
have never known anyone so vitally alive
he lived intensely  every fibre of him
remember him as he was  debonair and splendid
you did not see the moody morose brooding creature into which he devel oped
his heart was broken
in a single month i seemed to see my gallant boy turn into a wornout cynical man
asked you to come mr
holmes
in this house more than a year now and as i wished to lead a retired life i have seen little of my neighbours
three days ago i had a call from a man who said that he was a house agent
he said that this house would exactly suit a client of his and that if i would part with it money would be no object
it seemed to me very strange as there are several empty houses on the market which appear to be equally eligible but naturally i was interested in what he said
i therefore named a price which was five hundred pounds more than i gave
he at once closed with the offer but added that his client desired to buy the furniture as well and would i put a price upon it
some of this furniture is from my old home and it is as you see very good so that i named a good round sum
to this also he at once agreed
i had always wanted to travel and the bargain was so good a one that it really seemed that i should be my own mistress for the rest of my life
luckily i showed it to mr sutro my lawyer who lives in harrow
he said to me this is a very strange document
are you aware that if you sign it you could not legally take anything out of the house  not even your own private possessions
when the man came again in the evening i pointed this out and i said that i meant only to sell the furniture
sonal effects
but nothing shall go out of the house unchecked
my client is a very liberal man but he has his fads and his own way of doing things
it is everything or nothing with him
left but the whole thing seemed to me to be so unusual that i thought  here we had a very extraordinary interruption
holmes raised his hand for silence
then he strode across the room flung open the door and dragged in a great gaunt woman whom he had seized by the shoulder
she entered with ungainly struggle like some huge awkward chicken torn squawking out of its coop
stayin for lunch when this man jumped out at me
not wish to interrupt your most interesting narrative
just a little wheezy susan are you not
you breathe too heavily for that kind of work
susan turned a sulky but amazed face upon her captor
who be you anyhow and what right have you apullin me about like this
presence
did you mrs maberley mention to anyone that you were going to write to me and consult me
a message to say that your mistress was asking advice from me
its a wicked thing to tell fibs
whom did you tell
erous woman
i remember now that i saw you speaking to someone over the hedge
spoke
said holmes
worth ten pounds to you if you will tell me who is at the back of barney
ten you have in the world
have got so far you may as well give the name and earn the tenner
send for my box tomorrow
she flounced for the door
continued turning suddenly from lively to severe when the door had closed behind the flushed and angry woman this gang means business
look how close they play the game
your letter to me had the 10 pm postmark
and yet susan passes the word to barney
barney has time to go to his employer and get instructions he or she  i incline to the latter from susans grin when she thought i had blundered  forms a plan
black steve is called in and i am warned off by eleven oclock next morning
thats quick work you know
of course when people bury treasure nowadays they do it in the postoffice bank
but there are always some lunatics about
it would be a dull world without them
at first i thought of some buried valuable
but why in that case should they want your furniture
you dont happen to have a raphael or a first folio shakespeare without knowing it
teaset
should they not openly state what they want
if they covet your teaset they can surely offer a price for it without buying you out lock stock and barrel
no as i read it there is something which you do not know that you have and which you would not give up if you did know
it to a finer point
you have been in this house a year
from you
now suddenly within three or four days you have urgent demands
what would you gather from that
be has only just come into the house
has any object just arrived
let matters develop a little further until we have clearer data
is that lawyer of yours a capable man
banged your front door alone
might possibly want protection
what they are after i must approach the matter from the other end and try to get at the principal
did this houseagent man give any address
and valuer
business men dont conceal their place of business
well you will let me know any fresh development
i have taken up your case and you may rely upon it that i shall see it through
as we passed through the hall holmess eyes which missed nothing lighted upon several trunks and cases which were piled in a corner
the labels shone out upon them
them
how do we know that there is not something of value there
only his pay and a small annuity
what could he have of value
holmes was lost in thought
these things taken upstairs to your bedroom
examine them as soon as possible and see what they cohtain
i will come to morrow and hear your report
it was quite evident that the three gables was under very close surveillance for as we came round the high hedge at the end of the lane there was the negro prizefighter standing in the shadow
we came on him quite suddenly and a grim and menacing figure he looked in that lonely place
holmes clapped his hand to his pocket
you fair warning this morning
and i dont want no more talk about that affair of masser perkins
spose i can help you masser holmes i will
before
i dont know
my boss barney gives me orders and thats all
and everything under that roof is under my protection
dont forget it
son holmes remarked as we walked on
i think he would doublecross his employer if he knew who he was
it was lucky i had some knowledge of the spencer john crowd and that steve was one of them
now watson this is a case for langdale pike and i am going to see him now
when i get back i may be clearer in the matter
i saw no more of holmes during the day but i could well imagine how he spent it for langdale pike was his human book of reference upon all matters of social scandal
this strange languid creature spent his waking hours in the bow window of a st jamess street club and was the receiving station as well as the transmitter for all the gossip of the metropolis
he made it was said a fourfigure income by the paragraphs which he contributed every week to the gar bage papers which cater to an inquisitive public
if ever far down in the turbid depths of london life there was some strange swirl or eddy it was marked with automatic exact ness by this human dial upon the surface
holmes discreetly helped langdale to knowledge and on occasion was helped in turn
when i met my friend in his room early next morning i was conscious from his bearing that all was well but none the less a most unpleasant surprise was awaiting us
it took the shape of the following telegram
please come out at once
clients house burgled in the night
police in possession
sutro
holmes whistled
the drama has come to a crisis and quicker than i had expected
there is a great drivingpower at the back of this business watson which does not surprise me after what i have heard
this sutro of course is her lawyer
i made a mistake i fear in not asking you to spend the night on guard
this fellow has clearly proved a broken reed
well there is nothing for it but another journey to harrow weald
we found the three gables a very different establishment to the orderly household of the previous day
a small group of idlers had assembled at the garden gate while a couple of constables were examining the windows and the geranium beds
within we met a gray old gentleman who introduced himself as the lawyer together with a bustling rubicund inspector who greeted hoimes as an old friend
afraid
just a common ordinary burglary and well within the capacity of the poor old police
no experts need apply
to find them
it is that gang of barney stockdale with the big nigger in it  theyve been seen about here
chloroformed and the house was  ah
here is the lady herself
our friend of yesterday looking very pale and ill had entered the room leaning upon a little maidservant
ruefully
alas i did not take it
i did not wish to trouble mr sutro and so i was unprotected
neglected his advice and i have paid for it
hardly equal to telling me what occurred
susan had planned an entrance for them
they must have known the house to an inch
i was conscious for a moment of the chloroform rag which was thrust over my mouth but i have no notion how long i may have been senseless
when i woke one man was at the bedside and another was rising with a bundle in his hand from among my sons baggage which was partially opened and littered over the floor
before he could get away i sprang up and seized him
struck me for i can remember no more
mary the maid heard the noise and began screaming out of the window
that brought the police but the rascals had got away
sure there was nothing in my sons trunks
the man that i grasped
it was lying all crumpled on the floor
it is in my sons handwriting
the less i should be curious to see it
the inspector drew a folded sheet of foolscap from his pocketbook
pomposity
that is my advice to you mr holmes
in twenty five years experience i have learned my lesson
there is always the chance of fingermarks or something
holmes inspected the sheet of paper
see
holmes
you have noticed the number on the top of the page
it is two hundred and fortyfive
where are the odd two hundred and fortyfour pages
them
such papers as that
does it suggest anything to you inspector
grabbed at what came first to hand
i wish them joy of what they got
maberley
their luck upstairs
that is how i read it
what do you make of it mr
holmes
son
then as we stood together he read over the fragment of paper
it began in the middle of a sentence and ran like this but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart as he saw that lovely face the face for which he had been prepared to sacrifice his very life looking out at his agony and humilia tion
she smiled  yes by heaven
she smiled like the heartless fiend she was as he looked up at her
it was at that moment that love died and hate was born
man must live for something
if it is not for your embrace my lady then it shall surely be for your undoing and my complete revenge
paper back to the inspector
did you notice how the he suddenly changed to my
the writer was so carried away by his own story that he imagined himself at the supreme moment to be the hero
placed it in his book
what
are you off mr
holmes
the case is in such capable hands
by the way mrs maberley did you say you wished to travel
you a line in the evening
as we passed the window i caught a glimpse of the inspectors smile and shake of the head
these clever fellows have always a touch of madness
that was what i read in the inspectors smile
said holmes when we were back in the roar of central london once more
i think we had best clear the matter up at once and it would be well that you should come with me for it is safer to have a witness when you are dealing with such a lady as isadora klein
we had taken a cab and were speeding to some address in grosvenor square
holmes had been sunk in thought but he roused himself suddenly
see the lady who is behind all this mischief
you
she was of course the celebrated beauty
there was never a woman to touch her
she is pure spanish the real blood of the masterfui conquistadors and her people have been leaders in pernambuco for generations
she married the aged german sugar king klein and presently found herself the richest as well as the most lovely widow upon earth
then there was an interval of adventure when she pleased her own tastes
she had several lovers and douglas maberley one of the most striking men in london was one of them
it was by all accounts more than an adventure with him
he was not a society butterfly but a strong proud man who gave and expected all
but she is the belle dame sans merci of fiction
when her caprice is satisfied the matter is ended and if the other party in the matter cant take her word for it she knows how to bring it home to him
to marry the young duke of lomond who might almost be her son
his graces ma might overlook the age but a big scandal would be a different matter so it is imperative  ah
here we are
it was one of the finest cornerhouses of the west end
a machinelike footman took up our cards and returned with word that the lady was not at home
then we shall wait until she is said holmes cheerfully
the machine broke down
have to wait
kindly give this note to your mistress
he scribbled three or four words upon a sheet of his notebook folded it and handed it to the man
should pass us in
it did  with amazing celerity
a minute later we were in an arabian nights drawingroom vast and wonderful in a half gloom picked out with an occasional pink electric light
the lady had come i felt to that time of life when even the proudest beauty finds the half light more welcome
she rose from a settee as we entered tall queenly a perfect figure a lovely masklike face with two wonderful spanish eyes which looked murder at us both
asked holding up the slip of paper
your intelligence to do so  though i confess that intelligence has been surprisingly at fault of late
my work
surely no man would take up my profession if it were not that danger attracts him
it was you then who forced me to examine the case of young maberley
with hired bullies
holmes turned away wearily
noon
we had not got halfway to the door before she had overtaken us and was holding his arm
she had turned in a moment from steel to velvet
i feel that i may be frank with you mr holmes
you have the feelings of a gentleman
how quick a womans instinct is to find it out
i will treat you as a friend
but i represent justice so far as my feeble powers go
i am ready to listen and then i will tell you how i will act
yourself
yourself in the power of a band of rascals who may blackmail or give you away
frank i may say that no one save barney stockdale and susan his wife have the least idea who their employer is
as to them well it is not the first  she smiled and nodded with a charming coquettish intimacy
that feeds them
they will be arrested for this burglary
the police are already after them
paid for
i shall not appear in the matter
ans secret
she broke into a ripple of laughter and walked to the fireplace
there was a calcined mass which she broke up with the poker
did she look as she stood before us with a challenging smile that i felt of all holmess criminals this was the one whom he would find it hardest to face
however he was immune from sentiment
in your actions madame but you have overdone it on this occasion
she threw the poker down with a clatter
story
must realize it from the point of view of a woman who sees all her lifes ambition about to be ruined at the last moment
is such a woman to be blamed if she protects herself
chanced that he could not fit into my plans
he wanted marriage  marriage mr holmes  with a penniless commoner
nothing less would serve him
then he became pertinacious
because i had given he seemed to think that i still must give and to him only
it was intolerable
at last i had to make him realize it
barney and the boys drove him away and were i admit a little rough in doing so
but what did he do then
could i have believed that a gentleman would do such an act
he wrote a book in which he described his own story
i of course was the wolf he the lamb
it was all there under different names of course but who in all london would have failed to recognize it
what do you say to that mr
holmes
with it the old cruel italian spirit
he wrote to me and sent me a copy of his book that i might have the torture of anticipation
there were two copies he said  one for me one for his publisher
know
i found out that he had not heard from italy
then came douglass sudden death
so long as that other manuscript was in the world there was no safety for me
of course it must be among his effects and these would be returned to his mother
i set the gang at work
one of them got into the house as servant
i wanted to do the thing honestly
i really and truly did
i was ready to buy the house and everything in it
i offered any price she cared to ask
i only tried the other way when everything else had failed
now mr holmes granting that i was too hard on douglas  and god knows i am sorry for it
what else could i do with my whole future at stake
sherlock holmes shrugged his shoulders
felony as usual
how much does it cost to go round the world in firstclass style
the lady stared in amazement
will see that it comes to mrs maberley
you owe her a little change of air
meantime lady  he wagged a cautionary forefinger  have a care
have a care
you cant play with edged tools forever without cutting those dainty hands
